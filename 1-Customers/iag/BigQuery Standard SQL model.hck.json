The Chinese public transportation system between over 340\nprefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with\nlayers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail\nroutes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities,\nperipheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local\nspread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the\noverlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different\ntransmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the\ntransit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation\nvehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the\ninfected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the\nrecovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be\nused to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other\ncountries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction\nnumber, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from\nany Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective\ngovernment interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to\ntrigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from\nempirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The\nmodel is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that\nthe framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public\ncity-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.",

Here, we profiled more than 5,000 proteins along the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans. We find that one-third of proteins change in abundance at least 2-fold during aging, resulting in a severe proteome imbalance. These changes are reduced in the long-lived daf-2 mutant but are enhanced in the short-lived daf-16 mutant. While ribosomal proteins decline and lose normal stoichiometry, proteasome complexes increase. Proteome imbalance is accompanied by widespread protein aggregation, with abundant proteins that exceed solubility contributing most to aggregate load. Notably, the properties by which proteins are selected for aggregation differ in the daf-2 mutant, and an increased formation of aggregates associated with small heat-shock proteins is observed. We suggest that sequestering proteins into chaperone-enriched aggregates is a protective strategy to slow proteostasis decline during nematode aging.",

                    "sample": "Objective To evaluate whether systemic corticosteroids improve symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.\nDesign Systematic review and meta-analysis.\nData sources Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), NHS Health Economics Database, and bibliographies.\nOutcome measures Percentage of patients with complete resolution at 24 and 48 hours, mean time to onset of pain relief, mean time to complete resolution of symptoms, days missed from work or school, recurrence, and adverse events.\nResults We included eight trials, consisting of 743 patients in total (369 children, 374 adults). 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. In addition to antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids significantly increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (four trials) by more than three times (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1), and at 48 hours (three trials) to a lesser extent (1.7, 1.3 to 2.1). Corticosteroids (six trials) reduced mean time to onset of pain relief by more than 6 hours (95% confidence interval 3.4 to 9.3, P<0.001), although significant heterogeneity was present. The mean time to complete resolution was inconsistent across trials and a pooled analysis was not undertaken. Reporting of other outcomes was limited.\nConclusions Corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat, in addition to antibiotic therapy, mainly in participants with severe or exudative sore throat.\nSore throat is a common reason for people to seek medical care, accounting for about one in 50 of all ambulatory care visits and resulting in considerable costs.1 2 3 4 Most sore throats are self limiting5 and are caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus is responsible for about 10% of sore throats in adults and 15–30% of those in children.1 6\nTreatment of sore throat with antibiotics provides only modest beneficial effect in reducing symptoms and fever.7 87 8 However, prescribing rates remain disproportionately high.6 High rates of antibiotic prescriptions contribute to antibiotic resistance9 and also lead to the “medicalising” of sore throat, which can result in increased rates of patient (re)attendance.10 11 In developed countries, prescribing is no longer justified to prevent complications from group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infection. Peritonsillar abscess occurs in fewer than two in 10 000 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections,12 whereas non-suppurative complications (such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis) are extremely rare.8 13 14\nThe pressure for clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat leaves a therapeutic vacuum. Corticosteroids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators in human airway endothelial cells which cause pharyngeal inflammation and ultimately symptoms of pain.15 Corticosteroids are beneficial in other upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis, croup, and infectious mononucleosis.16 17 18 We therefore hypothesised that corticosteroids would offer similar symptomatic relief from sore throat because of their anti-inflammatory effects, and undertook a systematic review to examine the effect of systemic corticosteroids on adults and children with sore throat.\nWe included only randomised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo, in children or adults, in outpatient (ambulatory) settings. We also included studies of patients with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of “sore throat” (painful throat, odynophagia). We excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.\nWe searched Medline (1966 to 2008), Embase (1983 to 2008), the Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database from the beginning of each database until August 2008 using a maximally sensitive strategy.19 Terms used included “upper respiratory tract infection”, “pharyngitis”, “tonsillitis”, “sore throat”, and “corticosteroids” (including “dexamethasone”, “betamethasone”, “prednisone”, and all variations of these terms) and viral and bacterial upper respiratory pathogens (full search strategy available from authors). Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstracts of electronic searches, obtaining the full articles to assess for relevance where necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. We did citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved.\nTwo authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data using an extraction template. Disagreements were documented and resolved by discussion with a third author. We assessed methodological quality of studies by allocation concealment, randomisation, comparability of groups on baseline characteristics, blinding, treatment adherence, and percentage participation.\nPrimary outcomes included the proportion of participants with improvement or complete resolution of symptoms, mean times to onset of pain relief, and complete resolution of pain. Secondary outcomes included the reduction in pain measured by visual analogue scale, adverse events necessitating discontinuation of treatment, relapse rates, and days missed from school or work. Where necessary, data were extracted from graphs with the Grab It XP Microsoft Excel program (www.datatrendsoftware.com)\nWe did sensitivity analyses, excluding each study in turn, to determine the stability of the effect. A priori subgroup analyses included age, route of corticosteroid, presence of positive bacterial culture or direct antigen test, and severity of sore throat including presence of exudate. Meta-regression in STATA tested subgroup interaction on the outcomes. We selected the data closest to a single-dose regimen from those studies that used different dosing regimens in a single trial as our conservative strategy. Similarly, if both oral and intramuscular data were available, we used oral data for our overall analysis and intramuscular data for appropriate subgroup analysis.\nWe expressed dichotomous outcomes as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals and expressed continuous variables as weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. If data were sufficient for primary outcomes, we calculated the number needed to treat using the relative risk and the pooled event rates, in addition to the risk difference as calculated in RevMan 4.2. We used the I2 statistic to measure the proportion of statistical heterogeneity for each outcome.20 Where no heterogeneity was present, we undertook a fixed effect meta-analysis. If substantial heterogeneity (I2 above 50%) was detected, we looked for the direction of effect and where applicable used a random effects analysis. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by removing single trials to investigate the extent to which they contributed to the heterogeneity, particularly looking at baseline characteristics including severity.\nOf 3257 potentially relevant records identified, 26 were relevant to sore throat, tonsillitis, or pharyngitis (fig 1⇓). A further 17 studies were excluded because they examined postoperative or postintubation sore throat (13 studies), included inpatients (one), did not have a placebo group (one), or were duplicate publications (two). Of the nine that met our inclusion criteria, one was excluded for not describing the method of randomisation.21\nFig 1 Flowchart of search results\nThe eight studies included 743 patients (369 children, 374 adults): 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. Patients were recruited from emergency department and general practice settings in four countries: United States (five studies), Canada (one), Israel (one), and Turkey (one) (table 1⇓). Corticosteroids used included betamethasone 2 ml (estimated dose 8 mg, one study), dexamethasone (up to 10 mg, six studies; or prednisone 60 mg, one study): doses were reasonably comparable for their potency. Corticosteroids were administered either intramuscularly (three studies), orally (four), or both (one). Six trials used one dose of corticosteroids, and two trials prescribed more than one dose of corticosteroids to a subgroup of participants.w1 w2 In the eight included studies, methodological quality was high with a low risk of bias (for example, all trials reported adequate allocation concealment and clear methods of randomisation). Table 2⇓ reports the specific elements of methodological quality in the selected studies.\nCharacteristics of trials included in meta-analysis (see web appendix for references)\nMethodological quality of included studies (see web appendix for references)\nOutcome measures included complete pain resolution at 24 hours (four studies) and 48 hours (three studies), mean time to onset of pain relief (five), mean time to complete resolution of pain relief (six), reduction in visual analogue scale pain score (five), number of days missed from school or work (three), and recurrence rates (four). All eight trials prescribed antibiotics to both intervention and placebo groups and allowed simple analgesia. In four trials, analgesia use was recorded, which was not significantly different between placebo and corticosteroid groups. Two trials restricted analgesia to paracetamol for 24 hours or 72 hours, recording no difference in usew6 and not reporting usew7 respectively. Four trials reported outcomes separately for patients positive and negative for bacterial pathogens.w3-w6\nIn a pooled analysis of four trialsw1 w2 w6 w7 patients treated with corticosteroids were three times more likely to have complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1, P<0.001, I2=44%) (fig 2⇓). The number needed to treat was 3.7 (2.8 to 5.9). Significant effects were recorded in adult patients only (relative risk 4.3, 2.3 to 8.1, P<0.001)w1 w6 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (2.6, 1.6 to 4.3, P<0.001).w1 w2 w6 Data were insufficient to undertake further subgroup analysis.\nFig 2 Effect of corticosteroids on number of patients experiencing complete pain relief at 24 and 48 hours. See web appendix for references\nIn three trialsw1 w2 w7 corticosteroids also increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours (relative risk 1.7, 95%CI 1.3 to 2.1, P<0.001), number needed to treat was 3.3 (2.4 to 5.6) (fig 2⇑). Results were similar in trials with adult patients only (1.8, 1.3 to 2.3, P<0.001)w1 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (1.6, 1.2 to 2.1, P=0.004).w1 w2\nSix trials reported the mean time to onset of pain relief, which occurred at an average of 6.3 hours earlier with corticosteroids than without (95% CI 9.3 to 3.4, P<0.001) (fig 3⇓).w3-w8 The wide variation in individual response times caused high heterogeneity (I2=73%). A sensitivity analysis, which excluded each trial in turn, demonstrated a range of weighted mean difference of 5.1 to 7.2 hours, but no loss of significance. The majority of the heterogeneity arose from the trial by Tasar et al, which showed the largest benefit of corticosteroids with small standard deviations.w7 Removal of this trial from the meta-analysis gave a mean time to onset of pain relief 5.1 hours earlier in patients given corticosteroids.\nFig 3 Effect of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief in hours. See web appendix for references\nIn patients with an exudative sore throat, corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief (weighted mean difference 6.2 hours, 8.4 to 4.0). Similarly, we recorded a reduction in mean time to pain relief in sore throat that was bacterial pathogen positive (5.3, 8.0 to −2.6) and in trials selecting for severe sore throat (7.2, 10.1 to 4.3). All three categories of sore throat (exudative, bacterial pathogen positive, and severe) were significant (P<0.001) with no heterogeneity (I2=0) (fig 4⇓).\nFig 4 Effect of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief analysed by subgroup using meta-regression. PO=oral delivery. IM=intramuscular delivery\nThe direction of effect for mean time to onset of pain relief was similar in trials with adults only, in trials with intramuscular and oral routes of steroid administration, and in trials in which severe sore throat was not selected. The effect on children only, those with less than 50% exudative sore throat, and non-bacterial pathogen positive only did not reach significance .We did not find significant changes in mean time to onset of pain relief in trials with children only, trials with less than 50% exudative sore throat, and in the subgroup of patients with sore throat not positive for bacterial pathogens. Meta-regression analysis revealed no significant differences across all subgroups (fig 4⇑).\nFigure 5⇓ shows the change in visual analogue scale at baseline to 72 hours. The data from Bulloch et al’s trial display the lowest baseline visual analogue scale score (that is, less severe) and the least response at 24 and 48 hours.w3 This finding is reflected in the non-significant effect (and the smallest effect) observed in the mean time to onset of pain relief for this trial.\nFig 5 Mean pain score on visual analogue scale at baseline and after corticosteroids or placebo. See web appendix for references\nFive trials assessed the mean time to complete resolution of pain.w3-w5 w7 w8 High heterogeneity prevented pooling: three studies showed a benefit of corticosteroids,w5 w7 w8 and two showed non-significant effects in opposing directions. Time to complete resolution ranged from 15 to 45 hours in the corticosteroid group and 35 to 54 hours in the placebo group.\nOnly one trialw5 of 125 participants reported adverse events: five patients (three steroid, two placebo) were hospitalised for fluid rehydration, and three patients developed peritonsillar abscess (one steroid, two placebo). Three studies reported no significant differences in days missed from school or work.w1 w2 w4 Four trials reported no difference in the incidence of recurrent symptomsw1-w4 (measured between 5 days and 1 month after treatment), whereas one trial found significantly increased recurrence in the placebo group.w6\nCorticosteroids significantly increase the proportion of patients with sore throat who will experience complete resolution of pain at both 24 and 48 hours. Fewer than four patients need to be treated to prevent one patient continuing to experience a painful sore throat at 24 hours. Although corticosteroids decreased the mean time to onset of pain relief by 6 hours, pooled analysis showed significant heterogeneity. All effects were in addition to antibiotic use.\nWe found that the effects of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief were homogenous in severe, exudative, or bacterial pathogen positive sore throat alone. Our data do not support an effect in mild sore throat because only one study included patients with milder symptoms at baseline, and showed no significant effect. A meta-regression analysis showed no evidence of interactions across different subgroups (such as route of corticosteroid, age, severity) on the outcome of mean time to onset of pain relief.\nThe effects of corticosteroids on resolution of pain were most apparent in the initial 24 hours, which implies that a single dose of corticosteroids may be sufficient. This effect is similar to that seen in croup where a single dose is generally adequate.17 Furthermore, the one trial comparing three daily doses of dexamethasone with a single dose found no difference in effect.w2\nOur analysis had some limitations. Firstly, and most importantly, all of the included trials provided antibiotics to patients in both corticosteroid and placebo groups (either to all participants, or to all participants with group A β-haemolytic streptococcus culture or a positive rapid antigen test). Therefore, we do not know the effects of corticosteroids on sore throat symptoms independent of antibiotics.\nSecondly, various outcome measures were reported, in some cases with inadequate reporting, no standard deviations, or use of graphical representation only. Thirdly, significant heterogeneity occurred in some of our analyses; this was attributable mainly to one trial,w7 which demonstrated increased benefit of corticosteroids with small standard deviations. However, our results remained robust to the removal of this trial.\nFourthly, the outcome measure of mean time to onset of pain relief was limited by recall bias, because the estimation of the time when pain relief begins relies on patients’ subjective recall and recording. The mean time could also be skewed by a few participants who had sore throat pain for especially long or short periods. A median time may have been more appropriate, although there were insufficient data for us to calculate this.\nFinally, the limited number of trials meant that we were unable to assess publication bias using funnel plots, although we attempted to address this issue by using citation searching. Included studies were also underpowered to detect rare adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy, as well as relapse rates and days missed from work or school.\nOur findings suggest that in patients with severe or exudative sore throat, pain can be reduced and resolution hastened by use of corticosteroids in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Current UK practice is to assess the likelihood of group A streptococcus infection using the Centor criteria22 (tender lymphadenopathy, exudate, fever, absence of cough). Our research suggests that patients with severe or high Centor scoring sore throat would benefit from a single dose of corticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids will triple the likelihood of resolution at 24 hours and hasten this resolution by more than 6 hours, even in patients who have also been given antibiotics and analgesics.\nOur finding that the duration of pain is reduced by 6 hours seems modest. However, the decision to use any treatment involves balancing the benefit and potential harms of the therapy. Although our included studies were not sufficiently powered to detect adverse effects of short courses of oral corticosteroids, the treatment has been associated with little morbidity in the management of croup and asthma. Moreover, treatment is commonplace for other short lasting illnesses that cause distress for patients, such as antibiotics for cystitis. In this context, onset of pain relief 6 hours earlier may be an acceptable benefit to many patients, and may prevent antibiotic use (particularly in the context of delayed prescriptions).\nWe could not fully assess the best type, route, or dosing regimen of corticosteroids because of small sample sizes. Two studies which directly compared intramuscular and oral routes found no differences, and our subgroup comparison also showed no differences.23 w6 Therefore, the current evidence shows that oral corticosteroids are as beneficial as intramuscular preparations and are more acceptable to patients.\nIn the included studies antibiotic use could reflect clinical practice in North America, where most of the trials were performed. Prescribing and consultation patterns may be different in the UK or Europe, where no trials were undertaken. Therefore, additional trial data are warranted in European populations before the results can be deemed generalisable. We are also unsure of the benefits of corticosteroids in children because of the limitations on the reporting in these trials.\nFuture trials should be in antibiotic naïve patients, and include the number of patients who have resolution of symptoms at 24, 48, and 72 hours and standardised pain scores. They should be large enough to adequately assess adverse events and days missed from school or work. Use of the Centor criteria at baseline will facilitate classification of severity. Any effects of corticosteroids on potentially reducing antibiotic use will need to be balanced by the risk of medicalising what is usually a self limiting and short lasting infection. Further research should focus on the effects of corticosteroids on antibiotic use as well as longer term measures such as reattendance with recurrent sore throats. Additionally, further trials in children are warranted that adequately report the outcome measures outlined above.\nCorticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat. In the current analysis, most participants had severe or exudative sore throat. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences between trials, including severe sore throats and those in which severity was not stated. We found no evidence of significant benefit in children. Further research should target corticosteroid use in antibiotic-naïve patients.\nCorticosteroids are beneficial for symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections\nSore throat is a common condition in primary care\nRecent guidelines recommend that antibiotics should not be prescribed for sore throat\nAt 24 hours, patients with severe sore throat who are given corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics are three times more likely to report complete resolution of symptoms than those who do not receive corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids also reduce the time to mean onset of pain relief in this patient group by about 6 hours\nThe effect of corticosteroids independent of antibiotics is unknown and should be the focus of future research\nCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b2976\nWe thank Nia Roberts, Ed Diggines, and Emma Meats for their assistance with literature searching and organisation.\nContributors: GH performed the study appraisal, meta-analysis, wrote the first draft of the article, made critical revisions to the article, and is guarantor for this article.

In addition to antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids significantly increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (four trials) by more than three times (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1), and at 48 hours (three trials) to a lesser extent (1.7, 1.3 to 2.1). Corticosteroids (six trials) reduced mean time to onset of pain relief by more than 6 hours (95% confidence interval 3.4 to 9.3, P&lt;0.001), although significant heterogeneity was present. The mean time to complete resolution was inconsistent across trials and a pooled analysis was not undertaken. Reporting of other outcomes was limited.Conclusions Corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat, in addition to antibiotic therapy, mainly in participants with severe or exudative sore throat.

                    "sample": "BACKGROUND: Influencing the general public response to pandemics is a public health priority. There is a prevailing view, however, that the general public is resistant to communications on pandemic influenza and that behavioural responses to the 2009/10 H1N1 pandemic were not sufficient. Using qualitative methods, this paper investigates how members of the general public respond to pandemic influenza and the hygiene, social isolation and other measures proposed by public health. Going beyond the commonly deployed notion that the general public is resistant to public health communications, this paper examines how health individualism, gender and real world constraints enable and limit individual action. METHODS: In-depth interviews (n = 57) and focus groups (ten focus groups; 59 individuals) were conducted with community samples in Melbourne, Sydney and Glasgow. Participants were selected according to maximum variation sampling using purposive criteria, including: 1) pregnancy in 2009/2010; 2) chronic illness; 3) aged 70 years and over; 4) no disclosed health problems. Verbatim transcripts were subjected to inductive, thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents did not express resistance to public health communications, but gave insight into how they interpreted and implemented guidance. An individualistic approach to pandemic risk predominated. The uptake of hygiene, social isolation and vaccine strategies was constrained by seeing oneself ‘at risk’ but not ‘a risk’ to others. Gender norms shape how members of the general public enact hygiene and social isolation. Other challenges pertained to over-reliance on perceived remoteness from risk, expectation of recovery from infection and practical constraints on the uptake of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, respondents were engaged with public health advice regarding pandemic influenza, indicating that the idea of public resistance has limited explanatory power. Public communications are endorsed, but challenges persist. Individualistic approaches to pandemic risk inhibit acting for the benefit of others and may deepen divisions in the community according to health status. Public communications on pandemics are mediated by gender norms that may overburden women and limit the action of men. Social research on the public response to pandemics needs to focus on the social structures and real world settings and relationships that shape the action of individuals.",

She would like to know when she will become menopausal because she wishes to avoid a surgical procedure, but does not feel that she can tolerate many more heavy menstrual periods.; The cessation of ovarian function, termed menopause, is an occult event that is only evident after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. Longitudinal studies of the 12-month window that defines the final menstrual period (FMP; taken here as defining the onset of menopause) showed that variable estrogen, but no progesterone, production was observed during this time.1 Most of what is known about the timing of the FMP is based upon observations of menstrual interval tracking among women older than 45 years who had regular menstrual cyclicity before entering the transition. Women who have undergone hysterectomy or endometrial ablation have no bleeding events, precluding the use of menstruation to establish menopause. It is also difficult to establish menopause in women whose FMP occurs unusually early in life or in women with chronically irregular cycles or longstanding amenorrhea.",

Here we propose a tailored dynamic model accounting for community-specific transmission controls and medical resource availability. We trained the model using data from Wuhan and applied it to other countries. We show that isolating suspected cases is most effective in reducing transmission rate if the intervention starts early. Having more hospital beds provides leverage that diminishes with delayed intervention onset. The importance of transmission control in turn increases by 65% with a 7-day delay. Furthermore, prolonging outbreak duration by applying an intermediate, rather than strict, transmission control would not prevent hospital overload regardless of bed capacity, and would likely result in a high ratio (21% ~ 84%) of the population being infected but not treated. The model could help different countries design control policies and gauge the severity of suppression failure.",

However, the molecular mechanism that determines postnatal development and maturation of BAT is largely unknown. Here we show that METTL3 (a key RNA methyltransferase) expression increases significantly in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) after birth and plays an essential role in the postnatal development and maturation of iBAT. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 severely impairs maturation of BAT in vivo by decreasing m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts, which leads to a marked reduction in BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis and promotes high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data demonstrate that METTL3 is an essential regulator that controls iBAT postnatal development and energy homeostasis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most prevalent mRNA modifications in eukaryotes. Here the authors show that the m6A writer protein methyltransferase-like (METTL) 3 plays an important role for the development of brown adipose tissue.",

                    "sample": "Introduction\nObesity and its associated diseases affect billions of people around the world. Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Increasing energy expenditure is an efficient way to treat obesity1,2,3. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient to generate heat through uncoupling protein1 (UCP1)1,4. It has been shown that adult humans also have functional UCP1-positive brown adipocytes5,6,7, and activation of BAT by cold stimuli leads to a decrease in fat mass8. Brown adipocytes undergo postnatal development to mature and gain function9,10. Thus, identification of targetable factors that promote postnatal development and function of BAT is an attractive strategy for treating obesity.\nIt has been demonstrated that PRDM16 and PPARγ are early key transcriptional factors in the fate-determination of brown fat10,11,12,13. In addition, PGC-1α expression is induced by cold challenge or by β3-adrenergic agonists14,15. PGC-1α then triggers mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, and thermogenesis by inducing expression of Ucp1 and many other genes14,15. Whether their mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification regulates BAT development and energy expenditure is largely unknown.\nm6A is one of the most prevalent mRNA modifications in eukaryotes16. RNA m6A modification can be catalyzed by m6A writer proteins (METTL3/METTL14/WTAP)17,18, recognized by m6A reader proteins (YTHDF1-3)19,20, and removed by m6A eraser proteins (FTO and ALKBH5)21,22. Recent studies have demonstrated that m6A modification regulates most RNA processing steps, including mRNA splicing23, mRNA stability24, translation efficiency25, microRNA maturation26, and X chromosome imprinting27 by m6A writer, reader, and eraser proteins, which further modulate a variety of biological processes such as circadian rhythms28, DNA damage response29, stem cell differentiation30,31, and white fat cell differentiation32,33. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), a key RNA methyltransferase, has been demonstrated to regulate neurogenesis34, spermatogenesis35,36, early embryonic development31, stem cell pluripotency in mice30,31, and white fat cell differentiation in vitro37. However, whether METTL3-mediated m6A modification of mRNA regulates interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) postnatal development and thermogenesis is not investigated.\nHere, we report that METTL3 is an essential iBAT-enriched RNA methyltransferase and controls iBAT postnatal development and maturation by regulating m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts. BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 leads to a marked reduction in BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis and further promotes high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data demonstrate that METTL3 is an essential regulator that controls iBAT postnatal development and energy homeostasis.; Obesity and its associated diseases affect billions of people around the world. Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Increasing energy expenditure is an efficient way to treat obesity1,2,3. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient to generate heat through uncoupling protein1 (UCP1)1,4. It has been shown that adult humans also have functional UCP1-positive brown adipocytes5,6,7, and activation of BAT by cold stimuli leads to a decrease in fat mass8. Brown adipocytes undergo postnatal development to mature and gain function9,10. Thus, identification of targetable factors that promote postnatal development and function of BAT is an attractive strategy for treating obesity.\nIt has been demonstrated that PRDM16 and PPARγ are early key transcriptional factors in the fate-determination of brown fat10,11,12,13. In addition, PGC-1α expression is induced by cold challenge or by β3-adrenergic agonists14,15. PGC-1α then triggers mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, and thermogenesis by inducing expression of Ucp1 and many other genes14,15. Whether their mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification regulates BAT development and energy expenditure is largely unknown.\nm6A is one of the most prevalent mRNA modifications in eukaryotes16. RNA m6A modification can be catalyzed by m6A writer proteins (METTL3/METTL14/WTAP)17,18, recognized by m6A reader proteins (YTHDF1-3)19,20, and removed by m6A eraser proteins (FTO and ALKBH5)21,22.

BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 leads to a marked reduction in BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis and further promotes high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data demonstrate that METTL3 is an essential regulator that controls iBAT postnatal development and energy homeostasis.; Results\nMETTL3 is enriched in iBAT and associated with postnatal development of iBAT\nFirst, we observed that METTL3 was highly enriched in interscapular BAT (iBAT) compared with that in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) (Fig. 1a), indicating that METTL3 may regulate the function of iBAT. Next, to determine whether METTL3 is associated with the postnatal development of iBAT, we measured METTL3 expression in iBAT at different ages after birth. METTL3 protein levels were dramatically increased in iBAT at 1 day of age, reached the maximal level at 5 days of age, and began a slight decline after 10 days of age (Fig. 1b). As expected, the UCP1 levels were highly induced in iBAT at 1 day of age, reached the maximal level between 10 and 20 days of age, and began a slight decline after 20 days of age (Fig. 1b). These data demonstrate that METTL3 expression shows a similar expression pattern with UCP1 in iBAT during early development after birth, indicating that METTL3 may have an important role in the postnatal development of iBAT.\nFig. 1: METTL3 is enriched in iBAT and associated with postnatal development of iBAT.\na METTL3 and UCP1 protein levels in iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT of C57BL/6 male mice at 8 weeks of age. b METTL3 and UCP1 protein levels in iBAT at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 days after birth. These experiments were repeated three times independently with similar results.

Ucp1 expression is induced after 18 days of gestation and shows a rapid increase until 10 days after birth9. Thus, Ucp1-iCre is supposed to delete genes in iBAT shortly after birth. METTL3 protein levels in iBAT of BKO mice began to decline at 5 days of age (see below). METTL3 was specifically deleted in iBAT but not in other tissues such as eWAT, liver, and skeletal muscle in 8-week-old BKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 1d). We also noted that METTL3 was highly enriched in iBAT compared with that in eWAT (Supplementary Fig. 1d). We did not observe any difference in body weight (Supplementary Fig. 2a), iBAT morphology (Supplementary Fig. 2b), iBAT weight (Supplementary Fig. 2c), or cold challenge (Supplementary Fig. 2d) between Mettl3flox/flox and Ucp1-iCre mice. Therefore, we used Mettl3flox/flox mice as the control for BKO mice in the following experiments. Surprisingly, the morphology of iBAT in BKO mice appeared abnormal, enlarged and “whitening” roughly after 5 days of age (Fig. 2a–c). Consistently, the weight of iBAT in BKO mice was significantly higher than that of flox/flox mice (Fig. 2d), which did not affect the body weight gain of BKO mice during postnatal development (Fig. 2e). The enlarged iBAT was attributable to large cytosolic lipid droplet accumulation, resulting in an increase in average adipocyte size (steatotic hypertrophy) (Fig. 2c). The key thermogenic protein, UCP1, was significantly increased during postnatal development in iBAT of flox/flox mice, whereas its induction was blocked in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 2f). The blockage of UCP1 induction in iBAT of BKO mice during postnatal development was associated with the decline of METTL3 in BKO mice after 5 days of age (Fig. 2f). These data indicate that METTL3 is necessary for postnatal development of iBAT.\nFig. 2: METTL3 is required for postnatal development of iBAT.\na Gross appearance of iBATs in Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 days after birth.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nBAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 results in dramatically decreased expression of BAT-selective genes\nTo further explore the molecular mechanisms of the impaired postnatal development of iBAT in BKO mice, we examined the whole transcriptional profiles of iBAT in both BKO and flox/flox mice by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a, 530 genes were downregulated, and 1552 genes were upregulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed that genes related to developmental maturation, respiratory electron transport chain, adaptive thermogenesis, and energy deprivation were dramatically downregulated, whereas genes associated with inflammation, muscle system process, and muscle cell development were significantly upregulated (Fig. 3b). Quantitative PCR analysis further supported these RNA-seq data. The general markers of iBAT, such as adiponectin, aP2, Pparg, Glut4, and Cebpα, were dramatically decreased in BKO mice (Fig. 3c). Lipogenesis-, lipolysis-, and fatty acid oxidation-related genes, including Srebp1, Fasn, ATGL, MgII, Pparα, Cpt2, and Cpt1b, were also decreased in BKO mice (Fig. 3c). Thermogenic genes, including Pgc-1α, Ucp1, Prdm16, Adrb3, and Cidea, were significantly downregulated (Fig. 3c). UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARγ, and PRDM16 protein levels were also dramatically reduced in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 3d). Decreased PGC-1α levels also resulted in reduced mitochondrial number (Fig. 3e). In addition, most of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including the components of complexes I, II, III, IV, and V, were dramatically reduced in BKO mice (Fig. 3c, f). Interestingly, the genes associated with muscle system process and muscle cell development, including Acta1, Casq2, Tnnc1, Myoglobin, MHC-1β, MHC-IIα, and MEF2c, were dramatically increased in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 3c), indicating that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 may promote the brown fat-myoblast conversion. These data also suggest that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impairs postnatal development of iBAT by decreasing expression of BAT-selective genes.\nFig. 3: BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 dramatically decreases expression of BAT-selective genes RNA-seq analysis was performed in the iBATs of Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 8 weeks old.\na The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (BKO VS flox/flox) including 530 downregulated genes and 1552 upregulated genes were illustrated in a volcanoplot (fold change > 2 and q value < 0.005). b Top GO biological process terms enriched in downregulated and upregulated genes. c Relative mRNA levels (n = 5–8 for each group). d UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARγ, PRDM16, and GAPDH protein levels in iBATs of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice were determined by Western blot (n = 3 for each group). e Relative mitochondria number in iBATs of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 8; BKO, n = 6). f Mitochondrial complex protein levels in iBATs of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice were determined by western blot (n = 3 for each group).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nLipid uptake has an important role in lipid accumulation and BAT function39,40. CD36 is the main fatty acid transporter in iBAT39. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and its inhibitor angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) in iBAT controls cold-induced triglyceride uptake in BAT39,40. We measured the expression of Cd36, Lpl, and Angptl4. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, their mRNA levels were not altered in the iBAT of BKO mice. These data indicate that lipid uptake is not changed in the iBAT of BKO mice, which less likely contributes to the whitening of iBAT in BKO mice.\nMETTL3 is necessary for m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts\nTo further determine whether METTL3 regulates m6A modification of mRNA related to brown fat differentiation and thermogenesis, we performed m6A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (m6ARIP-seq) analysis in iBAT of BKO and control mice. Each sample was pooled from five mice for each group. Consistent with published m6ARIP-seq results41, the m6A peaks identified in iBAT of flox/flox control mice were enriched at stop codon and 3′-UTR and were characterized by the canonical GGACU motif (Fig. 4a, b). However, the m6A peaks in iBAT of BKO mice were dispersed at transcription start site, 5′-UTR, and stop codon, and the enriched motif was CCAUG (Fig. 4a, b). In the iBAT of flox/flox mice, we identified about 9989 significant m6A peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) in ~ 6845 transcripts (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4). There were 5383 transcripts exhibiting decreased m6A levels in the iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, m6A peaks in Prdm16, Pparg and Ucp1 transcripts were decreased in the iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 5a–c). Consistently, m6ARIP-RT-qPCR showed that the m6A modification in Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts were dramatically decreased in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 5d–f), which may contribute to reduced expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1.\nFig. 4: METTL3 is essential for mRNA m6A modification in iBAT.\nThe m6A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (m6ARIP-seq) analysis of iBATs were performed in 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice. a The enrichment of m6ARIP-seq peaks in iBAT of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice. b Consensus motif of m6A sites in iBAT of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice. c Heatmap of FoldEnrich in m6A peaks (BKO VS flox/flox).\nFull size image\nFig. 5: METTL3 is essential for m6A modification of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts.\na–c The read density from m6A-RIP-seq experiments on BKO–flox/flox pairs showing the m6A peaks identified in the Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts. d–f The m6A modification in Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts in iBAT of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice were measured by m6ARIP-RT-qPCR (n = 3 for each group). g–j Primary brown preadipocytes seeded in 24-well plates were co-transfected with pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vectors (Prdm16, Pparg, Ucp1), siRNAs (Scramble siRNA, siMettl3-1, siMettl3-2) and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) reporter plasmid by X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent for 24 h. Cells were then induced to differentiate for 48 h. METTL3 and GAPDH protein levels were measured by immunoblotting g. Relative Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 luciferase activity were measured and normalized to β-Gal levels h–j (Scr in h, n = 4; others, n = 5 biologically independent cell samples for each group). Data represent the mean ± SEM. Significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test analysis. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nTo further test whether the m6A modification at last exon and 3′-UTR of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts were associated with the expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1. We cloned the region into pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vector and performed luciferase assays in primary brown preadipocytes. Knockdown of Mettl3 by two individual siRNAs (siMettl3-1 or siMettl3-2) in primary brown preadipocytes resulted in a significant reduction of METTL3 protein levels (Fig. 5g). Either siMettl3-1 or siMettl3-2 significantly decreased Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 5h–j). To identify which m6A readers were responsible for this regulation, we performed siRNA-mediated m6A reader proteins (Ythdf1, Ythdf2, or Ythdf3) knockdown and luciferase assays. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a–h, knockdown of Ythdf1 by two individual siRNAs (siYthdf1-1 or siYthdf1-2) did not affect the luciferase activity of Prdm16, Pparg, or Ucp1, whereas knockdown of Ythdf2 by two individual siRNAs (siYthdf2-1 or siYthdf2-2) significantly reduced their luciferase activity. In addition, knockdown of Ythdf3 by siYthdf3-2 but not siYthdf3-1 significantly decreased Prdm16 and Ucp1 luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. 5i–l). Moreover, the expression of Ythdf2 and Ythdf3 were significantly increased in mature adipocytes compared with preadipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5m–o), indicating that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 may regulate brown adipocyte differentiation and BAT development. These data also indicate that METTL3 and YTHDF2/3 may coordinate with each other and regulate BAT development.\nMETTL3 is essential for brown adipogenesis in vitro\nMettl3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in mature primary brown adipocytes compared with preadipocytes (Fig. 6a), suggesting that METTL3 may directly regulate differentiation of brown adipocytes. To further determine whether METTL3 directly regulates the differentiation of brown adipocytes, we harvested the stromal–vascular fraction from the brown fat pads of Mettl3flox/flox mice. Primary brown preadipocytes were infected with Ad-βGal and Ad-Cre adenovirus and differentiated to mature brown adipocytes. As expected, Cre adenovirus infection caused the deletion of Mettl3 in primary brown adipocytes (Fig. 6b, f). Deletion of Mettl3 significantly impaired the differentiation of precursor cells, as revealed by decreased Oil Red O staining (Fig. 6c) and the expression of general brown adipocyte markers (Fig. 6d). In addition, deletion of Mettl3 in primary brown adipocytes significantly decreased the expression of genes involved in differentiation (Prdm16 and Pparg), thermogenesis (Pgc-1α, Ucp1, Adrb3, and Cidea), lipogenesis (Srebp1 and Fasn), lipolysis (ATGL, HSL, and MgII), fatty acid oxidation (Ppara, Cpt2, and Cpt1b) and oxidative phosphorylation (Cox5b, Ndufa8, Cox7a1, and Cox6b1) (Fig. 6d, e). UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARγ, and PRDM16 protein levels were also dramatically reduced in primary METTL3-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. 6f). Consistent with decreased expression of PGC-1α, the relative mitochondria number was dramatically decreased by 33% in METTL3 knockout brown adipocytes (Fig. 6g). These results suggest that METTL3 is necessary for brown adipogenesis in vitro.\nFig. 6: METTL3 is essential for brown adipogenesis.\na The Mettl3 mRNA levels in mature primary brown adipocytes (10 days after differentiation) and preadipocytes (before differentiation) (n = 9 for each group). b Relative Mettl3 mRNA levels in primary brown adipocytes from Mettl3flox/flox mice infected with Ad-Cre or Ad-βGal (Ad-Cre, n = 12; Ad-βGal, n = 11). c Oil red O staining of primary brown adipocytes from Mettl3flox/flox mice infected with Ad-Cre or Ad-βGal.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nBAT-specific Knockout of Mettl3 results in decreased energy expenditure\nNext, we tested the need for METTL3 in thermogenesis in vivo. Mettl3 mRNA levels were significantly increased after acute cold exposure (4 °C for 6 h) (Fig. 7a), indicating that METTL3 may promote thermogenesis. BKO mice displayed lower oxygen (O2) consumption and CO2 production rates during both light and dark cycles (Fig. 7b–e), with similar amounts of food intake and physical activity compared with flox/flox controls (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), indicating that energy expenditure was decreased in BKO mice. Furthermore, BKO mice were less able to defend against acute cold exposure (Fig. 7f). In addition, serum free fatty acid levels were much higher in BKO mice after cold challenge (Fig. 7g), which further supports impaired thermogenesis in BKO mice. The morphology of iBAT in BKO mice under the cold exposure condition still appeared abnormal, enlarged and “whitening” (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). These data suggest that METTL3 in BAT is necessary for thermogenesis.\nFig. 7: Mettl3 deficiency in BAT decreases energy expenditure and impairs cold tolerance.\na The Mettl3 mRNA levels in iBATs of WT mice after acute cold exposure for 6 h (22 °C, n = 8; 4 °C; n = 7). b, c The O2 consumption rates in 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 22 °C (n = 5–6 for each group). d, e The CO2 production rates in 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 22 °C (n = 5–6 for each group). f The rectal temperature of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice during acute cold exposure (4 °C) (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 10; BKO, n = 9). g Serum FFAs levels of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice housed at room temperature or after cold exposure (4 °C) for 6 h (22 °C Mettl3flox/flox, n = 9; 22 °C BKO, n = 8; 4 °C Mettl3flox/flox, n = 8; 4 °C BKO, n = 8).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nMETTL3 was exclusively expressed in iBAT, and BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impaired acute cold-induced thermogenesis, indicating that METTL3 may regulate browning of WAT in response to chronic cold exposure or the β-adrenergic agonist. To further test this hypothesis, BKO mice and flox/flox controls were exposed for chronic cold challenge (4 °C 7d) or injected with CL-316,243 for 4 days to induce browning of WAT. At room temperature, the weight of iWAT was similar between BKO and flox/flox mice (Supplementary Fig. 8a, c), and the thermogenesis related genes such as Ucp1 and Pgc-1α were not changed in iWAT of BKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 8b, d). However, after either chronic cold exposure or multiple injection of CL-316,243, the weight of iWAT showed higher in BKO mice, and the expression of Ucp1 and Pgc-1α were downregulated under both conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8a–d). These data indicate that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impairs the browning of WAT in response to chronic cold exposure or the β-adrenergic agonist.\nBAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 predisposes to high-fat diet-induced obesity\nReduced BAT thermogenesis contributes to obesity in both rodents and humans42,43. We next determined whether BAT Mettl3 expression was associated with obesity by measuring BAT Mettl3 expression in two obese mice models (high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice). METTL3 protein levels were lower in both DIO and ob/ob mice (Fig. 8a). Mettl3 mRNA levels were also significantly reduced in both DIO and ob/ob mice (Fig. 8b, c). These data suggest that METTL3 in iBAT might regulate energy metabolism and obesity.\nFig. 8: BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 predisposes to HFD-induced obesity.\na–c The METTL3 protein and mRNA levels in iBATs of HFD-fed mice, ob/ob mice and their respective control mice (NC, n = 11; HFD, n = 10; WT, n = 7; ob/ob, n = 7). d The growth curve of METTL3 BKO and Mettl3flox/flox mice fed HFD diet (5 weeks Mettl3flox/flox and BKO, n = 10 for each group; 6 weeks Mettl3flox/flox, n = 10; 6 weeks BKO, n = 12; 7–16 weeks Mettl3flox/flox and BKO, n = 12 for each group). e The fat and lean mass of 20-week-old HFD-fed mice (n = 5 for each group). f The rectal temperature of HFD-fed Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice during acute cold exposure (4 °C) (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 6; 0, 60, 120 min BKO, n = 5; 240 min BKO, n = 4). g The relative tissue weight of iBAT and liver in 20-week-old HFD-fed mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 8; BKO, n = 7). h Representative images of iBAT and liver from 20-week-old HFD-fed mice. i Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of iBAT and liver from 20-week-old HFD-fed mice.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nTo determine whether BKO mice are sensitive to HFD-induced obesity, BKO and control mice were fed with HFD (45% fat), and body weight was measured weekly. As shown in Fig. 8d, BKO mice gained more body weight than flox/flox mice after feeding with HFD. Fat mass was significantly increased in BKO mice, whereas the lean mass did not change (Fig. 8e). BKO mice under a HFD feeding condition also showed severely impaired cold tolerance (Fig. 8f). The relative weight of iBAT and liver was much higher in BKO mice (Fig. 8g). Consistently, the size of iBAT and liver were larger in BKO mice (Fig. 8h). Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed adipocyte hypertrophy and hepatosteatosis in BKO mice (Fig. 8i). Serum triglyceride levels were significantly increased in BKO mice (Fig. 8j). These data demonstrate that BKO mice were more prone to HFD-induced obesity.\nObesity leads to impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. To determine whether BAT METTL3 regulates systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, we performed glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests on mice fed with HFD for 8 weeks (16 weeks old). As shown in Fig. 9a, b, BKO mice displayed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Serum insulin levels in BKO mice were also higher (Fig. 9c), further supporting that BKO mice showed insulin resistance. Moreover, insulin-induced p-AKT(S473) levels were significantly decreased in the livers of BKO mice (Fig. 9d). These data suggest that decreased expression of Mettl3 in iBAT impairs systemic energy homeostasis, contributing to HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.\nFig. 9: BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 predisposes to HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.\na GTTs of 16-week-old HFD-fed mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 11; BKO, n = 10). b ITTs of 16-week-old HFD-fed mice (n = 10 for each group). c The serum insulin levels of 20-week-old HFD-fed mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 9; BKO, n = 6). d p-AKT(S473) and AKT protein levels of 20-week-old HFD-fed mice.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image; METTL3 is enriched in iBAT and associated with postnatal development of iBAT\nFirst, we observed that METTL3 was highly enriched in interscapular BAT (iBAT) compared with that in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) (Fig. 1a), indicating that METTL3 may regulate the function of iBAT. Next, to determine whether METTL3 is associated with the postnatal development of iBAT, we measured METTL3 expression in iBAT at different ages after birth. METTL3 protein levels were dramatically increased in iBAT at 1 day of age, reached the maximal level at 5 days of age, and began a slight decline after 10 days of age (Fig. 1b). As expected, the UCP1 levels were highly induced in iBAT at 1 day of age, reached the maximal level between 10 and 20 days of age, and began a slight decline after 20 days of age (Fig. 1b). These data demonstrate that METTL3 expression shows a similar expression pattern with UCP1 in iBAT during early development after birth, indicating that METTL3 may have an important role in the postnatal development of iBAT.\nFig. 1: METTL3 is enriched in iBAT and associated with postnatal development of iBAT.\na METTL3 and UCP1 protein levels in iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT of C57BL/6 male mice at 8 weeks of age. b METTL3 and UCP1 protein levels in iBAT at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 days after birth.

Ucp1 expression is induced after 18 days of gestation and shows a rapid increase until 10 days after birth9. Thus, Ucp1-iCre is supposed to delete genes in iBAT shortly after birth. METTL3 protein levels in iBAT of BKO mice began to decline at 5 days of age (see below). METTL3 was specifically deleted in iBAT but not in other tissues such as eWAT, liver, and skeletal muscle in 8-week-old BKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 1d). We also noted that METTL3 was highly enriched in iBAT compared with that in eWAT (Supplementary Fig. 1d). We did not observe any difference in body weight (Supplementary Fig. 2a), iBAT morphology (Supplementary Fig. 2b), iBAT weight (Supplementary Fig. 2c), or cold challenge (Supplementary Fig. 2d) between Mettl3flox/flox and Ucp1-iCre mice. Therefore, we used Mettl3flox/flox mice as the control for BKO mice in the following experiments. Surprisingly, the morphology of iBAT in BKO mice appeared abnormal, enlarged and “whitening” roughly after 5 days of age (Fig. 2a–c). Consistently, the weight of iBAT in BKO mice was significantly higher than that of flox/flox mice (Fig. 2d), which did not affect the body weight gain of BKO mice during postnatal development (Fig. 2e). The enlarged iBAT was attributable to large cytosolic lipid droplet accumulation, resulting in an increase in average adipocyte size (steatotic hypertrophy) (Fig. 2c). The key thermogenic protein, UCP1, was significantly increased during postnatal development in iBAT of flox/flox mice, whereas its induction was blocked in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 2f). The blockage of UCP1 induction in iBAT of BKO mice during postnatal development was associated with the decline of METTL3 in BKO mice after 5 days of age (Fig. 2f). These data indicate that METTL3 is necessary for postnatal development of iBAT.\nFig. 2: METTL3 is required for postnatal development of iBAT.\na Gross appearance of iBATs in Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 days after birth.

As shown in Fig. 3a, 530 genes were downregulated, and 1552 genes were upregulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed that genes related to developmental maturation, respiratory electron transport chain, adaptive thermogenesis, and energy deprivation were dramatically downregulated, whereas genes associated with inflammation, muscle system process, and muscle cell development were significantly upregulated (Fig. 3b). Quantitative PCR analysis further supported these RNA-seq data. The general markers of iBAT, such as adiponectin, aP2, Pparg, Glut4, and Cebpα, were dramatically decreased in BKO mice (Fig. 3c). Lipogenesis-, lipolysis-, and fatty acid oxidation-related genes, including Srebp1, Fasn, ATGL, MgII, Pparα, Cpt2, and Cpt1b, were also decreased in BKO mice (Fig. 3c). Thermogenic genes, including Pgc-1α, Ucp1, Prdm16, Adrb3, and Cidea, were significantly downregulated (Fig. 3c). UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARγ, and PRDM16 protein levels were also dramatically reduced in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 3d). Decreased PGC-1α levels also resulted in reduced mitochondrial number (Fig. 3e). In addition, most of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including the components of complexes I, II, III, IV, and V, were dramatically reduced in BKO mice (Fig. 3c, f). Interestingly, the genes associated with muscle system process and muscle cell development, including Acta1, Casq2, Tnnc1, Myoglobin, MHC-1β, MHC-IIα, and MEF2c, were dramatically increased in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 3c), indicating that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 may promote the brown fat-myoblast conversion. These data also suggest that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impairs postnatal development of iBAT by decreasing expression of BAT-selective genes.\nFig. 3: BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 dramatically decreases expression of BAT-selective genes RNA-seq analysis was performed in the iBATs of Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 8 weeks old.\na The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (BKO VS flox/flox) including 530 downregulated genes and 1552 upregulated genes were illustrated in a volcanoplot (fold change > 2 and q value < 0.005). b Top GO biological process terms enriched in downregulated and upregulated genes. c Relative mRNA levels (n = 5–8 for each group). d UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARγ, PRDM16, and GAPDH protein levels in iBATs of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice were determined by Western blot (n = 3 for each group). e Relative mitochondria number in iBATs of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 8; BKO, n = 6). f Mitochondrial complex protein levels in iBATs of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice were determined by western blot (n = 3 for each group).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nLipid uptake has an important role in lipid accumulation and BAT function39,40. CD36 is the main fatty acid transporter in iBAT39. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and its inhibitor angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) in iBAT controls cold-induced triglyceride uptake in BAT39,40. We measured the expression of Cd36, Lpl, and Angptl4. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, their mRNA levels were not altered in the iBAT of BKO mice. These data indicate that lipid uptake is not changed in the iBAT of BKO mice, which less likely contributes to the whitening of iBAT in BKO mice.\nMETTL3 is necessary for m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts\nTo further determine whether METTL3 regulates m6A modification of mRNA related to brown fat differentiation and thermogenesis, we performed m6A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (m6ARIP-seq) analysis in iBAT of BKO and control mice. Each sample was pooled from five mice for each group. Consistent with published m6ARIP-seq results41, the m6A peaks identified in iBAT of flox/flox control mice were enriched at stop codon and 3′-UTR and were characterized by the canonical GGACU motif (Fig. 4a, b). However, the m6A peaks in iBAT of BKO mice were dispersed at transcription start site, 5′-UTR, and stop codon, and the enriched motif was CCAUG (Fig. 4a, b). In the iBAT of flox/flox mice, we identified about 9989 significant m6A peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) in ~ 6845 transcripts (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4). There were 5383 transcripts exhibiting decreased m6A levels in the iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, m6A peaks in Prdm16, Pparg and Ucp1 transcripts were decreased in the iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 5a–c). Consistently, m6ARIP-RT-qPCR showed that the m6A modification in Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts were dramatically decreased in iBAT of BKO mice (Fig. 5d–f), which may contribute to reduced expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1.\nFig. 4: METTL3 is essential for mRNA m6A modification in iBAT.\nThe m6A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (m6ARIP-seq) analysis of iBATs were performed in 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice. a The enrichment of m6ARIP-seq peaks in iBAT of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice. b Consensus motif of m6A sites in iBAT of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice. c Heatmap of FoldEnrich in m6A peaks (BKO VS flox/flox).\nFull size image\nFig. 5: METTL3 is essential for m6A modification of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts.\na–c The read density from m6A-RIP-seq experiments on BKO–flox/flox pairs showing the m6A peaks identified in the Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts. d–f The m6A modification in Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts in iBAT of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice were measured by m6ARIP-RT-qPCR (n = 3 for each group). g–j Primary brown preadipocytes seeded in 24-well plates were co-transfected with pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vectors (Prdm16, Pparg, Ucp1), siRNAs (Scramble siRNA, siMettl3-1, siMettl3-2) and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) reporter plasmid by X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent for 24 h. Cells were then induced to differentiate for 48 h. METTL3 and GAPDH protein levels were measured by immunoblotting g. Relative Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 luciferase activity were measured and normalized to β-Gal levels h–j (Scr in h, n = 4; others, n = 5 biologically independent cell samples for each group). Data represent the mean ± SEM. Significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test analysis. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nTo further test whether the m6A modification at last exon and 3′-UTR of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts were associated with the expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1. We cloned the region into pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vector and performed luciferase assays in primary brown preadipocytes. Knockdown of Mettl3 by two individual siRNAs (siMettl3-1 or siMettl3-2) in primary brown preadipocytes resulted in a significant reduction of METTL3 protein levels (Fig. 5g). Either siMettl3-1 or siMettl3-2 significantly decreased Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 5h–j). To identify which m6A readers were responsible for this regulation, we performed siRNA-mediated m6A reader proteins (Ythdf1, Ythdf2, or Ythdf3) knockdown and luciferase assays. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a–h, knockdown of Ythdf1 by two individual siRNAs (siYthdf1-1 or siYthdf1-2) did not affect the luciferase activity of Prdm16, Pparg, or Ucp1, whereas knockdown of Ythdf2 by two individual siRNAs (siYthdf2-1 or siYthdf2-2) significantly reduced their luciferase activity. In addition, knockdown of Ythdf3 by siYthdf3-2 but not siYthdf3-1 significantly decreased Prdm16 and Ucp1 luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. 5i–l). Moreover, the expression of Ythdf2 and Ythdf3 were significantly increased in mature adipocytes compared with preadipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5m–o), indicating that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 may regulate brown adipocyte differentiation and BAT development. These data also indicate that METTL3 and YTHDF2/3 may coordinate with each other and regulate BAT development.\nMETTL3 is essential for brown adipogenesis in vitro\nMettl3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in mature primary brown adipocytes compared with preadipocytes (Fig. 6a), suggesting that METTL3 may directly regulate differentiation of brown adipocytes. To further determine whether METTL3 directly regulates the differentiation of brown adipocytes, we harvested the stromal–vascular fraction from the brown fat pads of Mettl3flox/flox mice. Primary brown preadipocytes were infected with Ad-βGal and Ad-Cre adenovirus and differentiated to mature brown adipocytes. As expected, Cre adenovirus infection caused the deletion of Mettl3 in primary brown adipocytes (Fig. 6b, f). Deletion of Mettl3 significantly impaired the differentiation of precursor cells, as revealed by decreased Oil Red O staining (Fig. 6c) and the expression of general brown adipocyte markers (Fig. 6d). In addition, deletion of Mettl3 in primary brown adipocytes significantly decreased the expression of genes involved in differentiation (Prdm16 and Pparg), thermogenesis (Pgc-1α, Ucp1, Adrb3, and Cidea), lipogenesis (Srebp1 and Fasn), lipolysis (ATGL, HSL, and MgII), fatty acid oxidation (Ppara, Cpt2, and Cpt1b) and oxidative phosphorylation (Cox5b, Ndufa8, Cox7a1, and Cox6b1) (Fig. 6d, e). UCP1, PGC-1α, PPARγ, and PRDM16 protein levels were also dramatically reduced in primary METTL3-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. 6f). Consistent with decreased expression of PGC-1α, the relative mitochondria number was dramatically decreased by 33% in METTL3 knockout brown adipocytes (Fig. 6g). These results suggest that METTL3 is necessary for brown adipogenesis in vitro.\nFig. 6: METTL3 is essential for brown adipogenesis.\na The Mettl3 mRNA levels in mature primary brown adipocytes (10 days after differentiation) and preadipocytes (before differentiation) (n = 9 for each group). b Relative Mettl3 mRNA levels in primary brown adipocytes from Mettl3flox/flox mice infected with Ad-Cre or Ad-βGal (Ad-Cre, n = 12; Ad-βGal, n = 11). c Oil red O staining of primary brown adipocytes from Mettl3flox/flox mice infected with Ad-Cre or Ad-βGal.

Mettl3 mRNA levels were significantly increased after acute cold exposure (4 °C for 6 h) (Fig. 7a), indicating that METTL3 may promote thermogenesis. BKO mice displayed lower oxygen (O2) consumption and CO2 production rates during both light and dark cycles (Fig. 7b–e), with similar amounts of food intake and physical activity compared with flox/flox controls (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), indicating that energy expenditure was decreased in BKO mice. Furthermore, BKO mice were less able to defend against acute cold exposure (Fig. 7f). In addition, serum free fatty acid levels were much higher in BKO mice after cold challenge (Fig. 7g), which further supports impaired thermogenesis in BKO mice. The morphology of iBAT in BKO mice under the cold exposure condition still appeared abnormal, enlarged and “whitening” (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). These data suggest that METTL3 in BAT is necessary for thermogenesis.\nFig. 7: Mettl3 deficiency in BAT decreases energy expenditure and impairs cold tolerance.\na The Mettl3 mRNA levels in iBATs of WT mice after acute cold exposure for 6 h (22 °C, n = 8; 4 °C; n = 7). b, c The O2 consumption rates in 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 22 °C (n = 5–6 for each group). d, e The CO2 production rates in 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 22 °C (n = 5–6 for each group). f The rectal temperature of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice during acute cold exposure (4 °C) (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 10; BKO, n = 9). g Serum FFAs levels of 8-week-old Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice housed at room temperature or after cold exposure (4 °C) for 6 h (22 °C Mettl3flox/flox, n = 9; 22 °C BKO, n = 8; 4 °C Mettl3flox/flox, n = 8; 4 °C BKO, n = 8).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nMETTL3 was exclusively expressed in iBAT, and BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impaired acute cold-induced thermogenesis, indicating that METTL3 may regulate browning of WAT in response to chronic cold exposure or the β-adrenergic agonist. To further test this hypothesis, BKO mice and flox/flox controls were exposed for chronic cold challenge (4 °C 7d) or injected with CL-316,243 for 4 days to induce browning of WAT. At room temperature, the weight of iWAT was similar between BKO and flox/flox mice (Supplementary Fig. 8a, c), and the thermogenesis related genes such as Ucp1 and Pgc-1α were not changed in iWAT of BKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 8b, d). However, after either chronic cold exposure or multiple injection of CL-316,243, the weight of iWAT showed higher in BKO mice, and the expression of Ucp1 and Pgc-1α were downregulated under both conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8a–d). These data indicate that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impairs the browning of WAT in response to chronic cold exposure or the β-adrenergic agonist.\nBAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 predisposes to high-fat diet-induced obesity\nReduced BAT thermogenesis contributes to obesity in both rodents and humans42,43. We next determined whether BAT Mettl3 expression was associated with obesity by measuring BAT Mettl3 expression in two obese mice models (high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice). METTL3 protein levels were lower in both DIO and ob/ob mice (Fig. 8a). Mettl3 mRNA levels were also significantly reduced in both DIO and ob/ob mice (Fig. 8b, c). These data suggest that METTL3 in iBAT might regulate energy metabolism and obesity.\nFig. 8: BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 predisposes to HFD-induced obesity.\na–c The METTL3 protein and mRNA levels in iBATs of HFD-fed mice, ob/ob mice and their respective control mice (NC, n = 11; HFD, n = 10; WT, n = 7; ob/ob, n = 7). d The growth curve of METTL3 BKO and Mettl3flox/flox mice fed HFD diet (5 weeks Mettl3flox/flox and BKO, n = 10 for each group; 6 weeks Mettl3flox/flox, n = 10; 6 weeks BKO, n = 12; 7–16 weeks Mettl3flox/flox and BKO, n = 12 for each group). e The fat and lean mass of 20-week-old HFD-fed mice (n = 5 for each group). f The rectal temperature of HFD-fed Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice during acute cold exposure (4 °C) (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 6; 0, 60, 120 min BKO, n = 5; 240 min BKO, n = 4). g The relative tissue weight of iBAT and liver in 20-week-old HFD-fed mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 8; BKO, n = 7). h Representative images of iBAT and liver from 20-week-old HFD-fed mice. i Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of iBAT and liver from 20-week-old HFD-fed mice.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image\nTo determine whether BKO mice are sensitive to HFD-induced obesity, BKO and control mice were fed with HFD (45% fat), and body weight was measured weekly. As shown in Fig. 8d, BKO mice gained more body weight than flox/flox mice after feeding with HFD. Fat mass was significantly increased in BKO mice, whereas the lean mass did not change (Fig. 8e). BKO mice under a HFD feeding condition also showed severely impaired cold tolerance (Fig. 8f). The relative weight of iBAT and liver was much higher in BKO mice (Fig. 8g). Consistently, the size of iBAT and liver were larger in BKO mice (Fig. 8h). Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed adipocyte hypertrophy and hepatosteatosis in BKO mice (Fig. 8i). Serum triglyceride levels were significantly increased in BKO mice (Fig. 8j). These data demonstrate that BKO mice were more prone to HFD-induced obesity.\nObesity leads to impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. To determine whether BAT METTL3 regulates systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, we performed glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests on mice fed with HFD for 8 weeks (16 weeks old). As shown in Fig. 9a, b, BKO mice displayed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Serum insulin levels in BKO mice were also higher (Fig. 9c), further supporting that BKO mice showed insulin resistance. Moreover, insulin-induced p-AKT(S473) levels were significantly decreased in the livers of BKO mice (Fig. 9d). These data suggest that decreased expression of Mettl3 in iBAT impairs systemic energy homeostasis, contributing to HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.\nFig. 9: BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 predisposes to HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.\na GTTs of 16-week-old HFD-fed mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 11; BKO, n = 10). b ITTs of 16-week-old HFD-fed mice (n = 10 for each group). c The serum insulin levels of 20-week-old HFD-fed mice (Mettl3flox/flox, n = 9; BKO, n = 6). d p-AKT(S473) and AKT protein levels of 20-week-old HFD-fed mice.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nFull size image; Discussion\nIn recent years, much progress has been made in identifying transcriptional factors and cofactors in the regulation of brown cell differentiation and thermogenesis. However, whether mRNA m6A modification regulates iBAT development and thermogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that METTL3 is an essential iBAT-enriched RNA methyltransferase and controls postnatal development of iBAT and thermogenesis by regulating m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts.\nMETTL3 is selectively expressed in iBAT and associated with brown fat cell differentiation. Deletion of Mettl3 leads to dramatically impaired brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing brown fat related genes, including Prdm16, Pparg, Pgc-1α, and Ucp1. Consistent with the in vitro observations, BAT-specific Mettl3 knockout mice display impaired postnatal development of iBAT and thermogenesis in vivo. iBAT in BKO mice displays steatotic hypertrophy and decreased mitochondria number at a very early age because of decreased expression of Prdm16, Pparg, Pgc-1α, and other BAT-selective genes. Therefore, BKO mice show reduced energy expenditure and are predisposed to HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.\nA key question is how METTL3 regulates the postnatal development of a brown fat gene program. METTL3 is well known for RNA m6A modification. It has been reported that METTL3 regulates stem cell differentiation by promoting RNA m6A modification of key transcriptional factors44. METTL3 also has been linked to white fat cell differentiation37. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 decreases iBAT-specific mRNA m6A modification and expression, including Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts.\nOne target of METTL3 is Prdm16, which has been shown to drive the differentiation of brow fat cells and browning of WAT by activating the expression of BAT-selective genes including Ucp1 and Pgc-1α11,45,46. Similarly, BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impaired BAT development and also impaired the development of beige adipocytes in iWAT. PRDM16 also controls the myoblast/brown fat switch47. Knockdown of Prdm16 downregulates BAT-selective genes and upregulates skeletal muscle-associated genes11,47. Likewise, BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 also downregulates BAT-selective genes and upregulates skeletal muscle-associated genes, which is likely owing to decreased PRDM16 expression. Mechanistically, BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 decreases m6A peaks of the Prdm16 transcript, which may be associated with decreased Prdm16 mRNA levels with the involvement of YTHDF2/3. These data indicate that METTL3 regulates iBAT postnatal development at least partially by regulating m6A modification and expression of the Prdm16 transcript. However, BAT-specific Prdm16 knockout mice show normal postnatal development of iBAT at a young age and display “whitening” and enlarged iBAT in old age10, whereas Mettl3 BKO mice show severely impaired postnatal development of iBAT at 5 days of age, suggesting that METTL3 in iBAT has certain actions that probably do not occur solely through modulation of Prdm16 expression.\nAnother target of METTL3 is Pparg, which has an essential role in adipocyte differentiation. Pparg-deficient mice display no brown or white adipose tissues48,49, suggesting that PPARγ is necessary for development of both BAT and white adipose tissue. BKO mice show significantly decreased m6A modification and expression of the Pparg transcript, which contributes to the impaired postnatal development of iBAT.\nAnother important target of METTL3 is Ucp1, which is a key thermogenic factor in iBAT. During postnatal development of iBAT, UCP1 and METTL3 protein levels are significantly increased. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 decreases m6A peaks and expression of the Ucp1 transcript, which contributes to impaired thermogenesis. However, Ucp1 knockout mice do not show enlarged iBAT50, suggesting that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 is less likely to result in enlarged iBAT solely through modulation of Ucp1 expression. Thus, it is possible that METTL3 acts as an essential regulator of postnatal development of iBAT and thermogenesis at least partially by controlling m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts simultaneously. However, we cannot rule out other possible mechanisms because METTL3 regulates m6A modification and expression of many other BAT-selective genes, based on the m6ARIP-seq and RNA-seq data.\nMETTL3-mediated mRNA m6A modification can be recognized by the individual m6A reader proteins, which play key roles in controlling gene expression. Early studies showed that YTHDF1 binding promotes translational efficiency51, YTHDF2-binding increases mRNA decay19, and YTHDF3 can assist the effects of YTHDF1 and YTHDF252,53. However, other roles for these reader proteins are rapidly emerging in the regulation of specific mRNAs in different types of cells during different stimuli29,54,55. In addition, the profiles and function of METTL3-mediated mRNA m6A are different depending on tissue and developmental stage41,56,57. For example, hypoxia increases m6A content of mRNA and enhances the stability of m6A modified mRNAs24, raising the possibility that m6A modification could also stabilize transcripts. In iSLK.219 cells, both METTL3 and YTHDF2 appear to promote lytic viral gene expression during Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection58. Another study shows that YTHDF2 also recognizes multiple m6A sites in the SV40 late transcripts and strongly promotes SV40 replication59. Our study shows that the expression of Mettl3 and Ythdf2 are increased during brown adipocyte differentiation. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 reduces m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts, indicating that m6A modification is required for the expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts in iBAT. Knockdown of either Mettl3 or Ythdf2 decreases the luciferase activity of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 in primary brown preadipocytes, indicating that METTL3 and YTHDF2 may play a similar role in brown adipogenesis. Future studies should clarify the function and the molecular mechanisms of YTHDF2 in the regulation of BAT development.\nIn addition, m6A pathway has been shown to regulate white adipocyte differentiation32,33,37,60,61. The well-studied protein in m6A pathway is FTO, which was previously identified by human genome-wide associated studies with strong association with obesity62. FTO promotes white adipocyte differentiation in vitro and development of obesity in vivo32,61, whereas deletion of FTO impairs white fat adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo32,33,60,63. The potential molecular targets include RUNX1T1, ATG5/7, and JAK232,33,60,61. Interestingly, knockdown of m6A writer proteins (METTL3, METTL14, or WTAP) in 3T3-L1 cells results in cell cycle arrest and impaired adipogenesis by suppressing expression of cyclin A237. These results indicate that m6A eraser and writer proteins play similar roles in white fat adipogenesis although their targets are different. With respect to WAT browning, FTO deficiency has been shown to induce UCP1 expression in white adipocytes64, whereas our study shows that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impairs the browning of WAT in response to chronic cold exposure or the β-adrenergic agonist, indicating that m6A eraser and writer proteins may play opposite roles in regulation of WAT browning and BAT development. Further investigations are necessary to fully explore the mechanisms of RNA m6A pathway (including other writer, reader, and eraser proteins) in controlling postnatal development of iBAT and energy metabolism.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that METTL3 is an essential BAT-enriched RNA methyltransferase and controls postnatal development of iBAT by regulating m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts. BAT-specific knockout of Mettl3 leads to a marked reduction of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis and results in obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data demonstrate that METTL3 is an essential regulator that controls postnatal development of iBAT and energy homeostasis.; In recent years, much progress has been made in identifying transcriptional factors and cofactors in the regulation of brown cell differentiation and thermogenesis. However, whether mRNA m6A modification regulates iBAT development and thermogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that METTL3 is an essential iBAT-enriched RNA methyltransferase and controls postnatal development of iBAT and thermogenesis by regulating m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts.\nMETTL3 is selectively expressed in iBAT and associated with brown fat cell differentiation. Deletion of Mettl3 leads to dramatically impaired brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing brown fat related genes, including Prdm16, Pparg, Pgc-1α, and Ucp1. Consistent with the in vitro observations, BAT-specific Mettl3 knockout mice display impaired postnatal development of iBAT and thermogenesis in vivo. iBAT in BKO mice displays steatotic hypertrophy and decreased mitochondria number at a very early age because of decreased expression of Prdm16, Pparg, Pgc-1α, and other BAT-selective genes. Therefore, BKO mice show reduced energy expenditure and are predisposed to HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.\nA key question is how METTL3 regulates the postnatal development of a brown fat gene program. METTL3 is well known for RNA m6A modification. It has been reported that METTL3 regulates stem cell differentiation by promoting RNA m6A modification of key transcriptional factors44. METTL3 also has been linked to white fat cell differentiation37. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 decreases iBAT-specific mRNA m6A modification and expression, including Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts.\nOne target of METTL3 is Prdm16, which has been shown to drive the differentiation of brow fat cells and browning of WAT by activating the expression of BAT-selective genes including Ucp1 and Pgc-1α11,45,46. Similarly, BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 impaired BAT development and also impaired the development of beige adipocytes in iWAT. PRDM16 also controls the myoblast/brown fat switch47. Knockdown of Prdm16 downregulates BAT-selective genes and upregulates skeletal muscle-associated genes11,47. Likewise, BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 also downregulates BAT-selective genes and upregulates skeletal muscle-associated genes, which is likely owing to decreased PRDM16 expression. Mechanistically, BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 decreases m6A peaks of the Prdm16 transcript, which may be associated with decreased Prdm16 mRNA levels with the involvement of YTHDF2/3. These data indicate that METTL3 regulates iBAT postnatal development at least partially by regulating m6A modification and expression of the Prdm16 transcript. However, BAT-specific Prdm16 knockout mice show normal postnatal development of iBAT at a young age and display “whitening” and enlarged iBAT in old age10, whereas Mettl3 BKO mice show severely impaired postnatal development of iBAT at 5 days of age, suggesting that METTL3 in iBAT has certain actions that probably do not occur solely through modulation of Prdm16 expression.\nAnother target of METTL3 is Pparg, which has an essential role in adipocyte differentiation. Pparg-deficient mice display no brown or white adipose tissues48,49, suggesting that PPARγ is necessary for development of both BAT and white adipose tissue. BKO mice show significantly decreased m6A modification and expression of the Pparg transcript, which contributes to the impaired postnatal development of iBAT.\nAnother important target of METTL3 is Ucp1, which is a key thermogenic factor in iBAT. During postnatal development of iBAT, UCP1 and METTL3 protein levels are significantly increased. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 decreases m6A peaks and expression of the Ucp1 transcript, which contributes to impaired thermogenesis. However, Ucp1 knockout mice do not show enlarged iBAT50, suggesting that BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 is less likely to result in enlarged iBAT solely through modulation of Ucp1 expression. Thus, it is possible that METTL3 acts as an essential regulator of postnatal development of iBAT and thermogenesis at least partially by controlling m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts simultaneously. However, we cannot rule out other possible mechanisms because METTL3 regulates m6A modification and expression of many other BAT-selective genes, based on the m6ARIP-seq and RNA-seq data.\nMETTL3-mediated mRNA m6A modification can be recognized by the individual m6A reader proteins, which play key roles in controlling gene expression. Early studies showed that YTHDF1 binding promotes translational efficiency51, YTHDF2-binding increases mRNA decay19, and YTHDF3 can assist the effects of YTHDF1 and YTHDF252,53. However, other roles for these reader proteins are rapidly emerging in the regulation of specific mRNAs in different types of cells during different stimuli29,54,55. In addition, the profiles and function of METTL3-mediated mRNA m6A are different depending on tissue and developmental stage41,56,57. For example, hypoxia increases m6A content of mRNA and enhances the stability of m6A modified mRNAs24, raising the possibility that m6A modification could also stabilize transcripts. In iSLK.219 cells, both METTL3 and YTHDF2 appear to promote lytic viral gene expression during Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection58. Another study shows that YTHDF2 also recognizes multiple m6A sites in the SV40 late transcripts and strongly promotes SV40 replication59. Our study shows that the expression of Mettl3 and Ythdf2 are increased during brown adipocyte differentiation. BAT-specific deletion of Mettl3 reduces m6A modification and expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts, indicating that m6A modification is required for the expression of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 transcripts in iBAT. Knockdown of either Mettl3 or Ythdf2 decreases the luciferase activity of Prdm16, Pparg, and Ucp1 in primary brown preadipocytes, indicating that METTL3 and YTHDF2 may play a similar role in brown adipogenesis. Future studies should clarify the function and the molecular mechanisms of YTHDF2 in the regulation of BAT development.\nIn addition, m6A pathway has been shown to regulate white adipocyte differentiation32,33,37,60,61. The well-studied protein in m6A pathway is FTO, which was previously identified by human genome-wide associated studies with strong association with obesity62. FTO promotes white adipocyte differentiation in vitro and development of obesity in vivo32,61, whereas deletion of FTO impairs white fat adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo32,33,60,63. The potential molecular targets include RUNX1T1, ATG5/7, and JAK232,33,60,61. Interestingly, knockdown of m6A writer proteins (METTL3, METTL14, or WTAP) in 3T3-L1 cells results in cell cycle arrest and impaired adipogenesis by suppressing expression of cyclin A237.

Mice were housed under controlled light (12-h light/12-h dark cycle), temperature (24 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 10%) conditions and fed a normal chow diet with a free access to water. For diet-induced obesity studies, mice were fed with an HFD (MD12032, 45% fat, Medicience). Mettl3flox/flox mice, in which the exon 2 and exon 3 of Mettl3 gene was flanked by two loxp sites, were generated by using CRISPR-Cas9 technique (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Southern blot data showed that the homologous recombination in Mettl3flox/+ mice were correct (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Ucp1-iCre mice, in which IRES-Cre was inserted between exon 6 and the 3′-UTR to allow Ucp1 and iCRE expression at the same time with lower levels, have been shown previously38. BAT-specific Mettl3 knockout mice were generated by crossing Mettl3 flox/flox mice with Ucp1-iCre mice.\nBody composition and energy metabolism measurement\nBody weight was measured weekly. Body composition (fat and lean mass) was determined by a body composition analyzer (Brucker Minispec LF50).

Control mice were kept at room temperature (22 °C). The core body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe (7001HT, Phyritemp) at each time point. For chronic cold exposure, mice were first treated with 3 days of the intermittent cold exposure (12 h at 4 °C in the light cycle and 12 h at room temperature), and then followed by 4 days of continued cold exposure at 4 °C66,67.\nChronic CL-316,243 treatment\nBKO and flox/flox mice were injected intraperitoneally with CL-316,243 at 1 mg/kg body weight or equal volume of saline daily for 4 days. Mice were killed on day 5 without addition injection.\nImmunoblotting\nCells or tissues were homogenized in an L-RIPA lysis buffer (R0020, Solarbio).

Digested tissue was filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer to remove large pieces, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 g to pellet the stromal–vascular fraction (SVF) cells. SVF cells were resuspended in complete culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and Pen/Strep), and then plated on collagen-coated 24-well plates. For preadipocyte differentiation, cells grown to 100% confluence (Day 0) were exposed to induction in DMEM containing 2 μg/mL dexamethasone, 1 μM insulin, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μM rosiglitazone, 1 nM T3, 62.5 μM indomethacin, and 10% FBS. Three days after induction (from Day 3), cells were maintained in media containing 1 μM insulin, 1 nM T3 and 10% FBS until ready for harvest (generally day 6–7 post differentiation). All chemicals for cell culture were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For adenoviral infection of primary SVF cells, 100% confluent cells were infected with Cyclization Recombination Enzyme (Cre) or βGal-expressing adenovirus in growth medium overnight. The medium was then switched to induction medium for 72 hr to induce adipogenic differentiation, and then cells were maintained in differentiation medium until ready for harvest. For oil-red staining, infected cells were maintained in differentiation medium for 3 days. For RT-qPCR and Western blot, infected cells were maintained in differentiation medium for 1 day.\nRNA-seq and m6ARIP-seq\nTotal RNA was extracted using Tripure Isolation Reagent (94015120, Roche) from iBAT of Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 8 weeks old. Each sample was pooled from four mice for each group. RNA-seq was performed by using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Paired-end clean reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (Ensemble_GRCm38.90) with TopHat (version 2.0.12), and the aligned reads were used to quantify mRNA expression by using HTSeq-count (version 0.6.1).\nFor m6ARIP-seq, total RNA was extracted using Tripure Isolation Reagent (94015120, Roche) from iBAT of Mettl3flox/flox and BKO mice at 8 weeks old. Each sample (300 μg total RNA) was pooled from five mice for each group. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (61006, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Chemically fragmented poly(A)+ RNA was incubated with m6A antibody (202003, Synaptic System) for immunoprecipitation following the standard protocol of Magna MeRIPTM m6A Kit (17-10499, MERK). Enrichment of m6A mRNA was then analyzed by high-throughput sequencing using Illumina Hiseq X platform. Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence by using skewer (Version: 0.1.126), and then mapped to Ensemble_GRCm38.90 whole genome using BWA (Version: 0.7.12-r1039) with parameters -T 25; -k 18. The m6A peaks were detected by MACS2 (Version 2.1.0), and the motif search was detected by HOMER findMotifGenome.pl (Version: v4.9.1)69.\nTransfection, siRNA knockdown, and luciferase assays\nBased on the above m6ARIP-seq data, we identified the last exon and 3′-UTR regions of Prdm16 (4: 154318508- 154319005), Pparg (6: 115489946-115490374), and Ucp1 (8: 83297793- 83298478), containing m6A modification sites. We cloned these regions into pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vector, respectively. Primary brown preadipocytes seeded in 24-well plates were co-transfected with these pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vectors, siRNAs (100 nM) and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) reporter plasmid by X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) for 24 h. Cells were then induced to differentiate for 48 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to β-Gal levels. siRNA targeted sequences were as follows: siMettl3-1: 5′-GCUACCGUAUGGGACAUUA-3′; siMettl3-2: 5′-CGGCUAAGAAGUCAAGGAA-3′; siYthdf1-1: 5′-GGGUUGAUUGUUGCAUCUUUA-3′; siYthdf1-2: 5′-GCCCACAGCUAUAACCCUAAA-3′; siYthdf2-1: 5′-GCAAACUUGCAGUUUAUGUAU-3′; siYthdf2-2: 5′-CCAUGCCCUAUCUAACUUCUU-3′; siYthdf3-1: 5′-ACCAAUGUCAGAUCCAUAUAU-3′; siYthdf3-2: 5′-CGUGUGGAGAUGUCCUAUUAA-3′; Scramble siRNA: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT.\nStatistical analysis\nData were presented as means ± S.E.

The m6A peaks were detected by MACS2 (Version 2.1.0), and the motif search was detected by HOMER findMotifGenome.pl (Version: v4.9.1)69.\nTransfection, siRNA knockdown, and luciferase assays\nBased on the above m6ARIP-seq data, we identified the last exon and 3′-UTR regions of Prdm16 (4: 154318508- 154319005), Pparg (6: 115489946-115490374), and Ucp1 (8: 83297793- 83298478), containing m6A modification sites. We cloned these regions into pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vector, respectively. Primary brown preadipocytes seeded in 24-well plates were co-transfected with these pMIR-REPORT Luciferase vectors, siRNAs (100 nM) and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) reporter plasmid by X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) for 24 h. Cells were then induced to differentiate for 48 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to β-Gal levels. siRNA targeted sequences were as follows: siMettl3-1: 5′-GCUACCGUAUGGGACAUUA-3′; siMettl3-2: 5′-CGGCUAAGAAGUCAAGGAA-3′; siYthdf1-1: 5′-GGGUUGAUUGUUGCAUCUUUA-3′; siYthdf1-2: 5′-GCCCACAGCUAUAACCCUAAA-3′; siYthdf2-1: 5′-GCAAACUUGCAGUUUAUGUAU-3′; siYthdf2-2: 5′-CCAUGCCCUAUCUAACUUCUU-3′; siYthdf3-1: 5′-ACCAAUGUCAGAUCCAUAUAU-3′; siYthdf3-2: 5′-CGUGUGGAGAUGUCCUAUUAA-3′; Scramble siRNA: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT.\nStatistical analysis\nData were presented as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.; Supplementary information\nSupplementary Information\nReporting Summary; Supplementary Information\nReporting Summary; Source data\nSource Data; Source Data",

                    "sample": "1. Introduction\nPeptic ulcer is an acid-induced lesion of the digestive tract that is usually located in the stomach or proximal duodenum, and is characterized by denuded mucosa with the defect extending into the submucosa or muscularis propria [1]. The estimated prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in the general population is 5&#8211;10% [2], but recent epidemiological studies have shown a decrease in the incidence, rates of hospital admissions, and mortality associated with peptic ulcer [3,4]. This is most likely secondary to the introduction of new therapies and improved hygiene, which resulted in a decline in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections. Traditionally, mucosal disruption in patients with the acid peptic disease is considered to be a result of a hypersecretory acidic environment together with dietary factors or stress. Risk factors for developing peptic ulcer include H. pylori infection, alcohol and tobacco consumption, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use, and Zollinger&#8211;Ellison syndrome [5]. The main risk factors for both gastric and duodenal ulcers are H. pylori infection and NSAID use [6]. However, only a small proportion of people affected with H. pylori or using NSAIDs develop peptic ulcer disease, meaning that individual susceptibility is important in the beginning of mucosal damage. Functional polymorphisms in different cytokine genes are associated with peptic ulcers. For example, polymorphisms of interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) affect mucosal interleukin 1&#946; production, causing H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases [7].On the other hand, the risk of complications of peptic ulcer is increased four times in NSAID users, and two times in aspirin users [8]. The concomitant use of NSAIDs or aspirin with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [9]. Although many people who use NSAIDs or aspirin have concurrent H. pylori infection, their interaction in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease remains controversial. A meta-analysis of observational studies resulted in a conclusion that NSAIDs, aspirin use, and H. pylori infection increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease independently [10].H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative, and aspirin-negative peptic ulcer disease, which is classified as an idiopathic ulcer, can be diagnosed in about one-fifth of cases [11]. It is caused by the imbalance between factors that contribute to mucosal integrity and aggressive insults, but the pathogenic mechanisms behind the development of idiopathic peptic ulcer are still unknown [5]. A Danish study showed that psychological stress could increase the incidence of peptic ulcer [12]. Other etiologies include ischemia, drugs (steroids, chemotherapeutic agents) and radiotherapy, viruses, histamine, eosinophilic infiltration, gastric bypass surgery, and metabolic disturbances [13].\n2. Pathogenesis of Peptic Ulcer\nAlmost half of the world&#8217;s population is colonized by H. pylori, which remains one of the most common causes of peptic ulcer disease [14]. The prevalence of H. pylori is higher in developing countries, especially in Africa, Central America, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe [15]. The organism is usually acquired in childhood in an environment of unsanitary conditions and crowding, mostly in countries with lower socioeconomic status. H. pylori causes epithelial cell degeneration and injury, which is usually more severe in the antrum, by the inflammatory response with neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages.The mechanism by which H. pylori induces the development of different types of lesions in the gastroduodenal mucosa is not fully explained. H. pylori infection can result in either hypochlorhydria or hyperchlorhydria, thus determining the type of peptic ulcer. The main mediators of H. pylori infection are cytokines that inhibit parietal cell secretion, but H. pylori can directly affect the H+/K+ ATPase &#945;-subunit, activate calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) sensory neurons linked to somatostatin, or inhibit the production of gastrin [16]. Although the formation of gastric ulcers is associated with hyposecretion, 10&#8211;15% of patients with H. pylori infection have increased gastric secretion caused by hypergastrinemia and reduced antral somatostatin content [17]. This leads to increased histamine secretion, and subsequently the increased secretion of acid or pepsin from parietal and gastric cells. Additionally, the eradication of H. pylori leads to a decrease in gastrin mRNA expression and an increase in somatostatin mRNA expression [18]. In the remaining majority of patients, gastric ulcers are associated with hypochlorhydria and mucosal atrophy.The main mechanism of NSAID-associated damage of the gastroduodenal mucosa is the systemic inhibition of constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis, and is associated with decreased mucosal blood flow, low mucus and bicarbonate secretion, and the inhibition of cell proliferation. NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme reversibly in a concentration-dependent manner. The co-administration of exogenous prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective NSAIDs use reduces mucosal damage and the risk of ulcers [19]. However, the different physicochemical properties of NSAIDs cause differences in their toxicity [20]. NSAIDs disrupt mucus phospholipids and lead to the uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thus initiating mucosal damage. When exposed to acidic gastric juice (pH 2), NSAIDs become protonated and cross lipid membranes to enter epithelial cells (pH 7.4), where they ionize and release H+. In that form, NSAIDs cannot cross the lipid membrane, and are trapped in epithelial cells, leading to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, decreased mitochondrial energy production, increased cellular permeability, and reduced cellular integrity. Patients who have a history of peptic ulcers or hemorrhage, are over the age of 65, also use steroids or anticoagulants, and take high doses or combinations of NSAIDs are at the highest risk for acquiring NSAID-induced ulcers [1]Main pathophysiological mechanisms and the sites of action of antiulcer treatment are shown in the Figure 1.\n3. Treatment\nAn overview of conventional antiulcer treatment options is summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.\n3.1. Helicobacter pylori Eradication\nAlthough successful H. pylori eradication alone is paramount for healing associated peptic ulcers and preventing relapses, the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance made it a global challenge. The first effective therapy was introduced in the 1980s, and consisted of a combination of bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole that was given for two weeks [14]. The standard first-line therapy is a triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics, such as clarithromycin plus amoxicillin or metronidazole given for seven to 14 days [32]. However, with an increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, especially for clarithromycin, there has been a marked decline in the success of triple therapy over the last 10&#8211;15 years. H. pylori eradication should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility tests. As susceptibility testing is often not available in clinical practice, the choice of first-line therapies should be based on the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and clarithromycin-based regimens should be abandoned in areas where the local clarithromycin resistance rate is more than 15% [36]. The rate of eradication can be increased with the use of high-dose PPI and by extending the duration to 14 days [37].The recommended standard first-line therapy is either a bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for 14 days (PPI, a bismuth salt, tetracycline, and metronidazole) or a 14-day concomitant therapy for patients intolerant of bismuth (PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole); both regimens yield eradication rates higher than 90% [38].Second-line therapy is prescribed if a first-line regimen fails, and should not include metronidazole or clarithromycin [39]. Levofloxacin triple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin, and levofloxacin) for 14 days seems to be an efficacious therapy, achieving eradication rates between 74&#8211;81% [33]. If a patient received first-line treatment with a clarithromycin-based regimen, a preferred treatment option is a bismuth quadruple therapy with eradication rates of 77&#8211;93%, or a high-dose dual-therapy regimen with amoxicillin and a PPI, as H. pylori rarely develops amoxicillin resistance [34]. Despite well-developed recommendations for choosing proper treatment regimens, 5&#8211;10% of patients have persistent infection. The most common reasons for the failure of two treatments are suboptimal compliance or the resistance of H. pylori to one or more antibiotics, in which case susceptibility testing is strongly recommended.When at least three recommended options have been unsuccessful, one of the commonly recommended salvage regimens is rifabutin-based triple therapy (PPI, rifabutin, and amoxicillin) for 10 days, with eradication rates of 66&#8211;70% [35], but rifabutin&#8217;s adverse effects such as myelotoxicity and red secretions should be taken into account [40].\n3.2. NSAID-Associated Ulcer Disease and the Use of PPIs\nMany strategies are available for the prevention of NSAID and aspirin-associated gastroduodenal ulcers and their complications, such as the co-therapy of NSAIDs with a PPI, H&#8322; receptor antagonist, or misoprostol; the use of COX-2-selective NSAIDs; or their combination with a gastroprotective agent. PPIs are the most popular and effective prophylactic agents [41]. The mechanism of action is reducing the production of gastric acid through irreversible binding to the hydrogen/potassium ATPase enzyme on gastric parietal cells. The combination of COX-2-selective NSAIDs and a PPI offers the best protection against peptic ulcer complications [42]. Standard doses of H&#8322; receptor antagonists cannot reduce the risk of gastric ulcers [43]. Gastrointestinal upset and abortifacient actions limit the use of misoprostol for gastric protection, despite its effective prevention of peptic ulcer complications. Ulcers heal in more than 85% of cases with six to eight weeks of PPI therapy if the offending agent is discontinued. All of the gastric ulcers require repeat endoscopy to evaluate the success of healing. If ulcers fail to heal, drug compliance should be checked. For refractory ulcers, the doubling of PPI dose for another six to eight weeks is often recommended, although the evidence supporting this is weak. After the exclusion of false-negative H. pylori status, unusual causes of peptic ulcer should be explored, such as malignancies, infections, Crohn&#8217;s disease, vasculitis, upper abdominal radiotherapy, cocaine use, and Zollinger&#8211;Ellison syndrome.PPIs are among the most commonly used and overprescribed medications in the world [44]. The side effects of the PPIs, such as a headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, are minor and easily managed. However, recent studies have suggested an association between PPI use and several serious adverse effects, which has been a source of major concern to patients and physicians. Some of the adverse effects of PPIs are related to their suppression of gastric acid secretion, allowing ingested microbial pathogens that would have been destroyed by gastric acid to colonize the upper gastrointestinal tract and cause infections. Reports are suggesting that the use of PPIs might increase the risk of enteric infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, community-acquired pneumonia [45], Clostridium difficile infections [46], and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [47].With gastric acid suppression, there is no stimulation of endocrine D cells to produce somatostatin, and thereby no inhibition of G cells for gastrin release, resulting in hypergastrinemia. Gastrin is a growth factor that can increase proliferation in Barrett metaplasia and the colon [48]. Nonetheless, PPI-induced hypergastrinemia in humans generally is mild, and rarely causes carcinoid tumors in human patients unless they have a genetic abnormality [49]. Furthermore, PPI usage might protect against cancer in Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, since PPIs heal the chronic esophageal inflammation of reflux esophagitis, which is a risk factor for the development of malignancy.Gastric acid inhibition by PPIs also can affect the uptake of certain vitamins, minerals, and medications. There are reports of patients on PPIs developing vitamin B12 deficiency and iron deficiency anemia [50]. Additionally, PPIs might increase the risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures by interfering with the ionization and solubilization of the calcium salts that are required for their absorption [51]. The underlying mechanism for hypomagnesemia is still not clear. PPI-induced gastric acid suppression decreases ketoconazole absorption and facilitates the absorption of digoxin [52]. Furthermore, PPIs can affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome (CYP) P450 system; for instance, they can delay the clearance of warfarin, diazepam, and phenytoin. Considerable attention has been given to the potential of PPIs to reduce the antiplatelet action of clopidogrel, since both are metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme [53]. The clinical importance of the interaction remains disputed, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings to avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel.There has been a dramatic increase in reports of miscellaneous, unanticipated adverse effects of PPIs over the past several years, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, acute and chronic kidney disease, and eosinophilic esophagitis. The increased frequency of cardiovascular events in patients on clopidogrel who also use PPIs can be the result of the drugs competing for metabolism by CYP2C19, although there is a possibility that PPIs might have cardiovascular effects that are independent of their effects on clopidogrel activation, perhaps by the decreased production of nitric oxide and altered vascular homeostasis [54]. It has been proposed that PPIs might contribute to the development of eosinophilic esophagitis through their effects on peptic digestion [55]. The suppression of acid production raises gastric pH and inactivates pepsin, inhibiting peptide ingestion and degradation, and causing allergic reactions in the small intestine.\n3.3. Potassium-Competitive Acid Blockers\nSince up to 13% of patients treated with lansoprazole still experience ulcer recurrence, the search for alternative treatment is ongoing. Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker that inhibits H+, K+-ATPase in gastric parietal cells at the final stage of the acid secretory pathway [25]. The difference in the mechanism of action between vonoprazan and PPIs is that vonoprazan inhibits the enzyme in a K+-competitive and reversible manner, and does not require an acidic environment for activation. Additionally, vonoprazan shows a rapid onset of action and prolonged control of intragastric acidity [26]. Vonoprazan at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg was non-inferior to lansoprazole for the prevention of peptic ulcer recurrence in Japanese patients during NSAID therapy [25], or those who required aspirin therapy for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular protection [27], with good tolerance, a similar safety profile, and no new safety issues. Also, five weeks of treatment with vonoprazan significantly reduced post-endoscopic submucosal dissection bleeding, compared to eight weeks of treatment with PPIs [28]. Similarly, it was shown to be superior to esomeprazole [29] and rabeprazole [26] for scarring artificial ulcers, which could help make an endoscopic submucosal dissection a safer treatment.\n3.4. Future Research Questions\nAlong with the global decline of peptic ulcer disease and in the prevalence of H. pylori, there is a rising problem of growing antimicrobial resistance, which reduces the efficiency of eradication therapy, and the overuse of PPIs, resulting in unexpected new side effects [56]. Also, the occurrence of idiopathic ulcers associated with high mortality is increasing [57], and there is a need for defining the optimum management of the idiopathic disease. There is still an open question of how H. pylori infection and NSAID or aspirin interact, leaving the best strategy to manage patients with both risks unresolved. The pathogenesis of H. pylori-related gastric lesions is still not fully understood. Its development is led by a combination of H. pylori virulent factors and the host immune response; however, the precise combination of H. pylori factors and the host genetic profile are yet to be fully enlightened. Why some patients are more susceptible than others to the gastric toxicity of NSAIDs and aspirin, and which genetic polymorphisms are associated with H. pylori-induced peptic ulcer also remain unclear.In the absence of any possible breakthrough antimicrobial agent for H. pylori, antibiotic resistance continues to be a major challenge, and new therapies are in fact old therapies. H. pylori urease has been at the center of attention for the development of antiulcer treatment. Several potent in vitro inhibitors have been found, but with poor specificity. They usually don&#8217;t make it to the clinical setting due to the high dosage required, increased cost of treatment, and increased risk for bleeding. Recent advances in the molecular description of H. pylori pathogenesis resulted in promising candidates related to the pathogen&#8217;s persistence in the host, such as adherence. Some antivirulence agents can selectively target the pathogen&#8217;s adherence, but a high binding affinity and genetic diversity in the receptor-binding site of H. pylori complicate the finding of potent inhibitors [58].The genetic diversity of the virulence proteome in H. pylori direct future antivirulence developments toward its more conserved assembly and secretion pathways, leaving the open question of how these inhibitors can contribute to H. pylori treatment.Gastrointestinal bleeding as the complication of peptic ulcer disease remains life-threatening, and comorbidities are now the primary cause of death in these patients. There is an urgent need for prospective data and randomized controlled trials to define the best patient care strategy. In the meantime, appropriate diagnostics, adherence to current guidelines, and the avoidance of inferior H. pylori treatment regimens will be necessary to maintain successful treatment of peptic ulcer.\n4. Alternative Therapy for Peptic Ulcer\nThe usage of medicinal plants in healing numerous diseases is as old as human beings, and well-known as phytotherapy. Moreover, in the past few years, there has been a rising interest in alternative therapies and the usage of herbal products, in particular, those produced from medicinal plants [59,60]. Also, due to appearance of various side effects by usage of conventional drugs for numerous diseases, medicinal plants are considered the major reservoir of potentially new drugs. Plant extracts and their crude are the most significant sources of new drugs, and have been shown to cause promising results in the treatment of gastric ulcer as well [61]. It is known that numerous pharmaceutical agents such as proton pump inhibitors, anticholinergics, antacids, antimicrobial agents, H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and bismuth are not fully effective, and produce numerous adverse effects such as impotence, arrhythmia, hematopoietic alterations, hypersensitivity, and gynecomastia [62,63]. Due to that, investigations of the new pharmacologically active agents through the screening of different plant extracts led to the discovery of effective and safe drugs with gastroprotective activity. Especially, plants with antioxidant capability as the main mechanism are used as the herbal reservoir for the treatment of ulcer disease [63].Medicinal plants have achieved their therapeutic properties from their capability to produce renewable and various secondary metabolites, which are known as phytochemical constituents. Hence, numerous plants have used these phytochemicals as a protection mechanism against pathogens [64].On the other hand, the appearance of resistant pathogens has had a significant influence on the pharmaceutical companies to change their strategy in the development of conventional antibiotics and design new antimicrobial drugs derived from medicinal plants [65]. Nevertheless, the synthetic antibiotics are still dominant as antimicrobial drugs.As a matter of fact, incidences of infectious diseases have enlarged within the last three decades, involving infections with different properties as well as new infections, and it has been shown that around 60% of them are of zoonotic origin (spread among human and animals). H. pylori is one of the major representatives in that group, and may cause chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and stomach cancer [66]. Therefore, one of the aims in this review was to highlight some medicinal plants that demonstrated significant antibacterial and antioxidant activity against H. pylori and peptic ulcer disease. However, some of plants lose their efficiency against H. pylori consequent to the emergence of resistant strains. Consequently, the isolation of various constituents from the most active plant extracts is encouraged [67].It is important to emphasize that herbal products may contain numerous bioactive constituents with dangerous, but also beneficial effects. Therefore, the higher education of doctors and patients about herbal therapy is necessary, as well as legislation to control the quality of herbal products, especially for further randomized investigations to determine the effectiveness and safety of many products in digestive and other disorders [68].Finally, the Ayurvedic knowledge and modern medicine could generate preferable antiulcer drugs derived from medicinal plants with less side effects [69].Numerous medicinal plants with significant antibacterial activity against H. pylori and benefits for gastric ulcer disease are shown in Table 3.\n4.1. The Effect on H. pylori Eradication\nSeveral factors influence the conventional therapy failure. These include: the poor bioavailability of antibiotics, as the gastric mucus layer plays a barrier to antibiotic delivery, and therefore the drugs are unable to obtain the underlying gastric epithelium [70]; the stomach containing a pH from acidic to neutral, and only a few antibiotics are active in a wide pH range [79]; bacterial antagonism to antibiotics, where co-infection with multiple strains is quite an important feature [80]; deficiency of patient permissiveness to the therapy; patients lifestyle, and diet [46].Numerous studies have been reported about various medicinal plants and their anti-H. pylori activity. In recent years, it has been shown that the suppression of enzymatic (dihydrofolate reductase, DNA gyrase, myeloperoxidase N-acetyltransferase, and urease) and adhesive activities, the high redox potential, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic natures of constituents have a significant role in anti-H. pylori action mechanisms. H. pylori-stimulated gastric inflammation may lead to superficial gastritis and atrophic gastritis, but also to gastric cancer. It is established that different natural products have anti-inflammation activity, and the fundamental mechanisms involve the inhibition of nuclear factor-&#954;B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation and the suppression of oxidative stress.Since the role of H. pylori infection regarding carcinogenesis is to ascend carcinogenesis instead to play a key role as a direct carcinogen, its eradication alone cannot inhibit H. pylori-related gastric cancers [81].Medical plants such as Allium sativum, Zingiber officinalis, Korean red ginseng, and Cistus laurifolius are known to suppress the colonization of H. pylori, reduce gastric inflammation by chemokine release, inhibit cytokine, and suppress precancerous changes by suppressing nuclear factor-kappa B DNA binding, which suppresses mutagenesis and produces abundant levels of apoptosis. Further unresolved issues will have to be cleared out before phytoceuticals are accepted as a standard therapy for H. pylori infection [82].\n4.2. Korean Red Ginseng\nKorean red ginseng extract plays a significant role in inhibiting H. pylori-induced 5-LOX activity, such as inactivating c-jun, repressing NF-&#954;B-DNA binding, inhibiting H. pylori-induced 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid biosynthesis, and preventing pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-8 or 5-LOX mRNA. Consequently, these mechanisms decrease gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, Korean red ginseng has been shown to be beneficial in suppressing 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) mRNA and enzyme activities, and consequently the decreased synthesis of 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid. Similarly, green tea extract may prevent the activation of multiple transcription factors and their target genes, involving COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, as well as the lipopolysaccharide of H. pylori-activated TLR-4. Due to that, these blockades increase the pro-inflammatory factors that induce gastric mucosal lesions [83,84]. Kim et al. reported on the protective effect of Korean red ginseng against H. pylori-induced cytotoxicity in vitro [83]. Meanwhile, in a previous clinical study, a supplementary administration of Korean red ginseng increased the eradication rates of H. pylori, reduced gastric inflammation, and decreased oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis [84].\n4.3. Allium Sativum\nThroughout history, the health benefits of garlic have been well documented, and the main use of Allium sativum was for its medicinal properties. The organosulfur components of Allium sativum, including S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) sulfoxides and &#948;-glutamyl S-allyl-L-cysteine, are known as main compounds of its bioactivity. Raw Allium sativum is easy to convert in bioinactive form. Accordingly, numerous types of its extract with different compositions of bioactive components have been developed, and their efficacy has been observed and evaluated in numerous studies [85]. The major role of Allium sativum extract has been observed in antioxidant effect by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and lowering the serum glucose induction of antioxidant enzymes. Also, it showed a suppressive effect of H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation in vivo [86], and an anti-tumorigenic effect by promoting apoptosis and the induction of cell cycle arrest [87]. Allicin and allyl-methyl plus methyl-allyl thiosulfinate from acetonic Allium sativum extracts have restricted the growth of H. pylori in the in vitro investigations [88].\n4.4. Cistus Laurifolius\nFlavonoids are one of the most important components of the human diet with a key role in organisms and significant responsibility for numerous biological activities, in particular, antioxidant. Due to their limited availability and high cost, a rapid synthesis of polyoxygenated flavones, starting from accessible and inexpensive flavanones, has been developed. By methoxylation and bromination protocol 3&#8242;-demethoxysudachitin, a restricted flavone with antimicrobial activity against H. pylori has been designed. Numerous investigations on flavoinoids were done with an extract of Cistus laurifolius. It has been demonstrated when testing for antimicrobial activity against H. pylori that 3&#8217;-demethoxysudachitin and sudachitin were the most active compounds. A similar investigation showed that the chloroform extract of Cistus laurifolius has tremendous anti-H. pylori activity. Accordingly to these investigations, isolated flavonoids can be used as an additive component for the standard treatment of H. pylori infection [82,89].Li HQ et al. observed diverse levels of anti-H. pylori activities in numerous isoflavones [90]. The experiment evaluated a few series of metronidazole-flavonoid extracts that have been used for antimicrobial activity against H. pylori [90]. It has been demonstrated that only one compound could remarkably achieve the enhancement in IL-8 levels in the gastric cancer cells induced with a H. pylori water extract. On the other hand, Nakagawa et al.&#8217;s experiments revealed that new flavonoid compounds 6, 7, and (2S)-4&#8242;,7-dihydroxy-8-methylflavan were discovered to be most efficacious compounds against H. pylori [91].Similarly, Ustun et al. discovered that the chloroform extract of Cistus laurifolius holds a significant anti-H. pylori effect [42]. Accordingly, isolated flavonoids can be used as an alternative or supplement compound to the current treatment of H. pylori infection [76].\n4.5. Zingiber Officinalis and Zingiber Zerumbet\nZingiber officinalis is known as ginger, which is consumed as a flavoring agent. The plant extract showed antitumor effects on colon cancer cells by inhibiting its growth, increasing DNA synthesis, and producing apoptosis [92]. Moreover, the main pungent phenolic compound of Zingiber officinalis is 6-gingerol, which has numerous pharmacological activities. Zingiber officinalis extracts containing gingerols have key role in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibition [73]. On the other side, the active phenolic compounds such as gingerol and zingerone have a significant influence in inhibiting parietal cell H+, K+-ATPase. Due to that, the activity of gingerol and zingerone plays a very important role in proton pump inhibition and the reduction of gastric acid secretion. Also, it shows a protective effect against H. pylori-induced ulcers [74].Jiang et al. demonstrated the therapeutic effect of Zingiber officinalis as a natural antioxidant against gastric ulcers [93]. They reported free Zingiber officinalis extracts limitations such as slight solubility in gastric juices, which will reduce further as it passes to higher pH regions of duodenum or ileum in rats; numerous medicaments show a restricted transit time of less than two to four hours in the stomach; whichever part is solubilized will be instantly absorbed, because Zingiber officinalis extract indicates fast absorption, consequently, local therapeutic effect cannot be elicited adequately [93].In addition, Sidahmed et al. showed that zerumbone from Zingiber zerumbet has a major role in gastroprotection activity against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model in rats. They demonstrated that pretreatment with zerumbone or omeprazole in rats significantly reduced ulcer area formation compared to the ulcer control group. Moreover, pretreatment with omeprazole at 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) (p < 0.05) obstructed formation of ulcer by 76.77%, while pretreatment of zerumbone at five and 10 mg/kg b.w. obstructed ulcer formation by 75.59% and 88.75%, respectively. On the other hand, zerumbone and its gastroprotective mechanisms were not tested against other ulcer model; hence, other mechanisms may be implicated and their influence needs to be investigated and elucidated [94].\n4.6. Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea Polyphenols)\nNowadays, Camellia sinensis is one of the most commonly used beverages. The chemopreventive effects of Camellia sinensis depend on its activity as an antioxidant, but also on its molecular regulatory functions on cellular growth, development, and apoptosis; and a selective improvement in the function of the intestinal bacterial flora. Between the numerous constituents of green tea, polyphenols and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) gene expression [95]. On the other hand, the urease of H. pylori is crucial for its colonization, and investigations concentrated on Camellia sinensis extract demonstrated the inhibitory activity of this enzyme. That results in the inhibition of bacterial colonization [96]. Numerous similar studies demonstrated the inhibitory effect of Camellia sinensis extract by increasing cell vacuolation by vacuolating cytotoxin A (vacA) and urea conduction in H. pylori infection. Consequently, it could pursue anti-H. pylori activity in vivo [97].In 2008, Rao et al. reported on the gastroprotective activity of 50% ethanolic extract of Ficus glomerata fruit (FGE) in gastric ulcer models in rats [98]. FGE was administered per mouth (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight), twice daily for five days for prevention from ethanol (EtOH), pylorus ligation (PL), and cold restraint stress (CRS), which induced ulcer formation. It demonstrated a dose-dependent suppression of ulcer, and it had a significant role in preventing the oxidative damage of gastric mucosa by preventing lipid peroxidation and significantly reducing in H+/K+-ATPase and superoxide dismutase. Their results showed that F. glomerate has an important gastroprotective effect that might be consequent to the gastric defense factors [98].\n4.7. Curcuma Longa and Artemisia Asiatica\nMedicinal plants with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity have had a demonstrated effect on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The medicinal plants and herbal preparations with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms include Curcuma longa, Panax quinquefolium, Artemisia asiatica, and Lonicera japonica. Moreover, other mechanisms include: the down-regulation of the genes encoding proteins that have key role in acute inflammation, including 1 intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2-beta (CINC-2-2 beta) (Panax quinquefolium); ameliorating the function and gastric mucus (Morus alba, Curcuma longa); reducing gastric acid, such as for instance Curcuma longa, Morus alba, and acidinol syrup, increasing tonic contractions of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) (Salvia miltiorrhiza, STW 5), and preventing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 b and TNF-a (STW 5) [99].It is important to mention investigation on rats where pretreatment with compounds of Artemisia asiatica (DA-9601) reduced the overall density of the esophageal wall and volume of ulceration beyond the ranitidine group [100].Mahattanadul showed in his study on rats that the rhizome of Curcuma longa plays a protective role in the formation of acute acid reflux esophagitis (RE), but it was not effective in the prevention of chronic acid RE [101]. However, its combination with dimethyl sulfoxide as an antioxidant compound reduced the severity of the esophagitis ulcer index to around that of lansoprazole. In contrast, lansoprazole inclined to elevate the severity of all histopathological changes above the control and curcumin-treated groups. Hence, it seemed that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin plays a major role in its beneficial effects on GERD [101].Herbal medicine can be a mighty weapon for suppressing or modulating the disease-associated footprints of H. pylori infection and eradication. Finally, those plant products have shown strong potential as pharmaceutical candidates in gastric disease prevention [68].\n5. Herb–Drug Interactions\nTogether with increasing use of herbal supplements worldwide, the number of adverse events and drug interactions is rising. Interactions between an herbal supplement and a drug can manifest as a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction. Pharmacokinetic interaction is a result of using the same mechanism of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion between an herbal supplement and a co-administered drug, leading to the change of the drug&#8217;s concentration in the blood and pharmacologic action. Pharmacodynamic interactions involve a direct effect on the mechanism of action of a co-administered drug without changing the drug&#8217;s concentration, only by antagonizing or exacerbating the drug&#8217;s clinical effects [77].Allium sativum extract decreases concentrations of drugs transported by P-gp, such as digoxin, doxorubicin, rosuvastatin, and verapamil [102]. The most studied Allium sativum interactions is the one with warfarin, although this has not yet been confirmed by controlled clinical trials. Also, it inhibits platelet aggregation, so it should be used with caution in patients with clotting disorders or those with anticoagulant therapy [103]. Zingiber officinalis prolongs bleeding time by the inhibition of thromboxane synthetase, but this has not been confirmed in a clinical trial [104]. Ginkgo biloba could increase bleeding risk, especially in combination with anticoagulant drugs, due to the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba have antiplatelet activity, but do not affect blood coagulation or platelet function in humans [103]. In combination with NSAIDs, it can cause severe bleeding [105].Panax ginseng induces cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which decreases the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers, certain antihypertensive and statin medications, and some antidepressants [106]. Panax ginseng has hypoglycemic activity in patients with diabetes, and may cause headache, trembling, and manic behavior in patients treated with phenelzine [107].Green tea extract has been shown to increase simvastatin concentrations [108], or inhibit the drug transporters organic anion transporting protein 1a1 (OATP1A1) and anion transporting protein 1a12 (OATP1A2), which are responsible for the transport of fluoroquinolones, beta blockers, and imatinib [77].Of the conventional antiulcer treatment, it is important to emphasize the many drug interactions of cimetidine [109]. Studies have reported clinically important interactions with warfarin, phenytoin, diazepam, chlormethiazole, propranolol, lidocaine, and a number of other drugs [110]. Also, cimetidine can increase the level or effect of green tea due to CYP1A2 inhibition, which consequently inhibits the hepatic oxidative metabolism of caffeine [111].\n6. Conclusions\nThe combination of herbal products and standard anti-gastric ulcer drugs might present a synergistic effect against H. pylori and gastric ulcer disease and improve the outcome for patients with gastric ulcer. With only a few human studies, it is suggested to conduct further clinical studies with larger sample sizes on the efficacy and safety of medicinal plants with antiulcer activity. Also, it would be beneficial to design studies to investigate and further elucidate the mechanisms of action of medicinal plants used for the treatment or prevention of peptic ulcer.Finally, herbal products used for medicinal purposes require licensing in order to ameliorate their safety and quality, and ensure that randomized controlled investigations validate demands of its possible efficacy. With increased reports of herb&#8211;drug interactions, there is still a problem of deficient research in this field, with no measures taken to address this problem. Hence, pharmacists and doctors should be aware especially of the risks associated with the usage of herbal preparations, whether on their own or in combination with other herbal or standard conventional therapy.",

The formation of peptic ulcers depends on the presence of gastric juice pH and the decrease in mucosal defenses. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are the two major factors disrupting the mucosal resistance to injury. Conventional treatments of peptic ulcers, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists, have demonstrated adverse effects, relapses, and various drug interactions. On the other hand, medicinal plants and their chemical compounds are useful in the prevention and treatment of numerous diseases. Hence, this review presents common medicinal plants that may be used for the treatment or prevention of peptic ulcers.",

Essential contributions to these dynamics come from the community of microbes (the microbiome) inhabiting the human digestive tract. The composition and function of the microbiome are shaped by available nutrients, and reciprocally, these organisms produce an as yet poorly defined repertoire of molecules that communicate with the epithelial barrier and the mucosal immune system. We present evidence that diet-derived vitamins and lipids regulate immunity and metabolic function and highlight the diverse mechanisms through which these effects are impacted by sex. We discuss exciting new data emerging from studies using high-throughput sequencing technology, specialized mouse models, and bio-specimens, and clinical data from human subjects that have begun to reveal the complexity of these interactions. Also profiled in this chapter are the striking sex differences in pathways by which dietary nutrients and gut microbes modify metabolism, immunity, and immune- and inflammation-mediated diseases. Although the incidence, severity, and therapeutic responses of many autoimmune diseases differ by sex, the molecular mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood.",
